    <p>
    Nina is the name of a person. The middle part of the name has broken free
    though; those letters have (in order) taken up positions somehow belonging
    to this person.
    </p>

  exolve-question: What is the full name of the person of interest? (5-6,7) MARIE-SOPHIE GERMAIN
  exolve-question: What's is the significance of the location(s) of the letters of the middle name? (?) Sophie Germain primes
  exolve-question: What are the three clues connected somehow to the Person of Interest? (?) 9A, 18A, 5D

  exolve-nina: a9 c9 e9 g9 k9
  exolve-nina: c15 e15 i15 a12 c6 o4
  exolve-nina: o9 a7 e7 i7 k7 m7 o7

  exolve-explanations:
    <p>
    The person is MARIE-SOPHIE GERMAIN. This French mathematician and physicist
    has a class of prime numbers named after her. A prime number p such that
    2p+1 is also prime is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain_prime">Sophie Germain prime</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Squares 2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 29 (which are all the Sophie-Germain-prime-numbered
    squares in the grid) have SOPHIE. MARIE GERMAIN forms the Nina running
    across.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally, the following clues are somewhat thematic:
    <ul>
    <li>9A. The number 41 is also a Sophie Germain prime (the first one after
    29).</li>
    <li>18A. The surface is applicable to Marie-Sophie Germain’s life.</li>
    <li>5D. The surface is applicable to Marie-Sophie Germain’s work.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    There are many easy clues (hidden words, anagrams, acrostics) in this
    puzzle. The leading question may be a bit challenging, but I think it
    should still be fairly accessible. I expect solvers to notice that they
    have to find a Nina with 5+7=12 letters, which should help in locating it.
    Then, having located MARIE GERMAIN, a little research would lead them to
    the full solution, even if they are not familiar with this interesting
    historical French woman.
    </p>
    <p>
    This puzzle’s theme is similar to the theme of my last one,
    “Hidden Figure;” they make a set together: a small tribute to women
    mathematicians.
