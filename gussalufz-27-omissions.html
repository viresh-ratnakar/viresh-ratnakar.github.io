  exolve-preamble:
    Each across clue omits one or more letters from its
wordplay. Figure out a few ways to connect and recover
the omissions.
  exolve-explanations:
    The preamble says:
<blockquote>
<i>
Figure out a few ways to connect and recover the omissions.
</i>
</blockquote>
This should be parsed as:
<blockquote>
<i>Figure out a few ways to connect
and [thereby!] recover the omissions.</i>
</blockquote>
Each omission of letters in an across clue's wordplay
is from consecutive letters at the beginning or end of
the solution entry, and forms one of two parts of a nina
going over two across lights. Each such nina is
"a way to connect" in two ways:
<ul>
<li>It connects two across lights in the grid.</li>
<li>It's a word synonymous with a way to connect.</li>
</ul>
