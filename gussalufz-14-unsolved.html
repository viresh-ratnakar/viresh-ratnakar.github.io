  exolve-prelude:
    <p>
    A 7×7 area at the center of the grid has been cleared completely. Moreover,
    enums for words beginning or ending in this area have been omitted in
    the clues.
    </p>
    <p>
    After filling the grid and identifying all the black
    squares in the central area (press the spacebar to fill a square with
    black), you should be able to put two and two together.
    Putting this discovery next to a preceding word from the neighbourhood
    would give you a famous title.
    </p>
    <p>
    The puzzle also features six interesting
    features of the title, including some leading characters.
    </p>
