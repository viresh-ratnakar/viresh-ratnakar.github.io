    <p>
    Please look for the following as you solve this puzzle:
    <blockquote>
        (a) Letter with Nina’s shape.<br/>
        (b) Number of the second word ending in Nina’s initials.<br/>
        (c) Number of the first word ending in Nina’s initials.<br/>
        (d) Nina.
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
    JOIN the above ANSWERS  to fill the blanks in the phrase:
    <blockquote>
    ??? ???????? ???????? instructions
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
    Do an internet search on this phrase to find a set of instructions.
    Some of the instructions thus found can be used to fill in the three-letter
    parts that are left unclued in the wordplay in all the clues for words that
    do not touch Nina.
    </p>
    <p>
    Only three such three-letter parts are used as fillers in all those clues.
    The nine letters from these three fillers can be jumbled to complete the
    following sentence:
    <blockquote>
    Products that worked with the above used to have this ????: ????? inside.
    </blockquote>
