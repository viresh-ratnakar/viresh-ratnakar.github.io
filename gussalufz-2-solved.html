    This puzzle was featured in the book,
    <i><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Cryptic_Crossroads.html?id=kLUzDwAAQBAJ">Cryptic Crossroads</a>,</i>
    Compiled by Sowmya Ramkumar, to mark the third anniversay of 1ACross.
    </p>
  exolve-explanations:
    <h3>Accompanying write-up in the book, <i>Cryptic Crossroads</i></h3>
    <p>
    Paraphrasing the late comedian Mitch Hedberg: "I used to do cryptic
    crosswords. I still do, but I used to too."
    </p>
    <p>
    Indeed, I used to solve and occasionally set cryptic crosswords in my
    college days in the late eighties, in IIT-Bombay, India. A civilized day
    back then involved staying up all night discussing life, questionably
    tearing off crosswords from the morning papers allegedly meant to be shared
    by the whole hostel, solving these questionably torn off crosswords, eating
    somewhat questionable hostel breakfast, and then calling it a day.
    </p>
    <p>
    Life had the last laugh and moved along, away from that period of
    insouciance. For most of 1990s and 2000s, crosswords slumped and sulked in
    my back seat as I drove through grad school, marriage, jobs, and parenting.
    Then, CCS and 1AC blossomed and crosswords returned to the front seat,
    indignantly reminding me of just how much fun they are. The situation now
    is that cryptic crosswords and 1AC enrich my life in more ways than I can
    presently and comfortably reveal. I sincerely appreciate the wonderful job
    that the 1AC admins do every single day.
    </p>
    <p>
    Apart from cryptic crosswords, I enjoy wine, scotch, beer, running, eating,
    reading, cooking, cuddling with my children (eighteen and ten and
    canine—all rather alarmed by my cuddling), computer programming, and wine.
    Did I remember to include wine?
    </p>
    <p>
    Apart from cryptic crosswords, wine, scotch, beer, running, eating, reading,
    cooking, cuddling, and programming, I am into the scientific method,
    atheism, consent-driven interactions, equality for all humans,
    healthcare for all humans, comprehensive living rights for all humans,
    and wine (just the red kind, but not bloody Merlot or Zinfandel).
    </p>
    <p>
    The title of my crossword ("Many Rustams") alludes to the disproportionately
    many hidden-word-ish clues it bears, invoking that old Persian dark horse
    military general, Rustam. The legends of Rustam's canny exploits led to the
    Hindi phrase, Chhupa ("hidden") Rustam, referring to someone who is simple
    on the surface but bears secrets underneath.
