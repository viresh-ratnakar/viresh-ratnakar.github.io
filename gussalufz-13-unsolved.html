  exolve-prelude:
    <p>
    Filling the grid by trusting the numbered clues will work almost
    everywhere. In a couple of cases though, such trust would be misplaced.
    For these exceptions, the setter has (elsewhere in the grid) provided
    pointers to point out what needs to be done. Stare at the grid, squinting
    if necessary, to find the pointers.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once you've figured out what needs to be done, you can also fill in the
    first two blanks below (indicated by question marks). The third blank is
    supplied by Nina.
