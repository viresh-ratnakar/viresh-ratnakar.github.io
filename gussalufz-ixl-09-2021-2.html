    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword has one small, extra layer of cryptic
trickery. The clue for 8 Down reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
3-5? (3-5)
</blockquote>
<p>
The surface seems to be questioning the veracity of the
enum! As an added distraction, 3 and 5 add up to 8, the
clue number.
</p>
<p>
The correct parsing is to take the solutions of clues 3, 4,
and 5 (i.e., the clues in the range 3-5) to form the 8 Down
clue as:
<i>Baker offers delivery? (3-5)</i>
This can then be solved as a reverse anagram clue to get
the solution OFF-BREAK.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram. It was used in the second preliminary
round in the finals of Indian Crossword League's (IXL) 2021
competition.
