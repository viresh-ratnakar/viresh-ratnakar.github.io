Eight clue solutions need to be permuted into anagrams after
deleting one letter, before they can be entered into the
grid. These anagrams follow a theme, as does an anagram of
the deleted letters.
The enumeration shown in each of these eight clues is for
the grid entry (that is, it indicates a length that is
one less than the length of the clue's solution).
</p>
<p style="font-size:small">
Please submit your solution and comments using the
form below the grid. You can submit multiple times, but please
try to limit to no more than 5-ish submissions. The submissions form
will be open till Sunday, April 16, 2023, 5 PM (Pacific).
Your name and comments will be included, along with the full results,
in the solved version posted afterwards. You can use an arbitrary
pseudonym as your name, if you prefer.
</p>
