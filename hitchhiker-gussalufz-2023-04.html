Eight clue solutions need to be permuted into anagrams after
deleting one letter, before they can be entered into the
grid. These anagrams follow a theme, as does an anagram of
the deleted letters.
The enumeration shown in each of these eight clues is for
the grid entry (that is, it indicates a length that is
one less than the length of the clue's solution).

We had opened up this puzzle for online submissions in April 2023.
The top three solvers were: (1) Venkatraghavan S, (2) Cobibh, (3) Debasmita Basu.
You can see the complete results, including comments and feedback from
solvers, after clicking on "Reveal All."

  exolve-question: What is the thematic anagram of the eight deleted letters?
  exolve-question: Any other thematic observations? (200)* [lowercase-ok]
  exolve-explanations:
    <p>
The eight thematic entries are all related to
that delightful and zany work of science fiction by
Douglas Adams, 
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy</a></i> (THGTTG).  
</p>

<p>
In THGTTG, the PLANET (23, <i>A Wanderer</i>)
EARTH (30, <i>Home Sweet Home</i>) is destroyed, 
MICE (26, <i>Small Creatures</i>) turn out to be spectacularly more
intelligent than suspected, the rock band DISASTER (5, <i>A Band's
Part</i>) Area produces the  loudest  noise possible in the universe,
Heart of GOLD (13, <i>A Ship's Heart</i>) is a spaceship powered by
the Infinite Improbability Drive that quite improbably creates an
ill-fated, planet-crashing WHALE (24D, <i>A Big Creature</i>),
Krikkit robots go on LASER (6A, <i>A Kind Of Gun</i>) gun destruction
sprees, and the character RANDOM (21, <i>A Little Dent</i>) Dent travels
across dimensions.
</p>

<p>
There are four additional connections to the theme:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The eight extra letters make the anagram, FORTY-TWO,
which is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, in THGTTG.
</li>
<li>
The title of
the puzzle also leads to 42, as "Random Number," or the
number of the light where RANDOM is entered, is 21, and
when that is "Doubled," we get 42.
</li>
<li>
The letters THGTTG appear as a nina running across the
sixth row from the top.
</li>
<li>HARMLES can be seen as a nina 
running down the sixth column and it can be interpreted 
cryptically as <i>Mostly Harmless,</i> the title of the 
concluding novel in the series. 
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Results</b></p>
<p>
We added the grid score (1 point for each correct cell,
for a maximum of 162 points) to 5 points per correct
additional thematic connection from the four listed above.
Many solvers identified some connections to the theme that
we hadn't even spotted! We have noted these belowâ€”surely
they confirm the fundamental interconnectedness of
all things.
</p>

<p>
Here are the top 10 solvers in order of points scored
and then time of submission.

<ul id="feedback">
<li><b>Aashwina mouli.</b></li>
<li><b>Agrippa.</b> Excellent puzzle.</li>
<li><b>Ahab.</b> Fun puzzle and great clues!</li>
<li><b>Ashit Hegde.</b> Very challenging puzzle. Several great clues. 6A, 15A, 21A, 3D, 13D 25D to name a few.</li>
<li><b>Binay Kumar Patra.</b> Better luck for me next time.</li>
<li><b>Cobibh.</b> I only noticed the 8 phrases in italics as I was solving 13d. I doubt I would have got it otherwise. Seeing the hidden phrase early made it possible to work backwards for some of the themed entries. Very enjoyable! I particularly liked 10a for the hidden phrase, and 8d for making me dig out a word I'd almost forgotten. And excellent theme! Slight quibbles with the repetition in the clue and answer for 6d, and with the definition in 20d.</li>
<li><b>Debasmita Basu.</b> Some excellent clues, 22D being my COTD.</li>
<li><b>D Narayana Swamy.</b> Everything is Cryptic...</li>
<li><b>e.a.</b> just reread the book last month after many years, and now this! calculating probability...</li>
<li><b>Fez.</b> Don't know enough but Marvin (and Vogon poetry?) could be DULL? Beeblebrox refers to Dent as a semi-evolved SIMIAN? And they make use of a towel ... from a TOILET SET? Lots of fun, thanks!</li>
<li><b>Ganesh Nayak.</b> [THGTTG] what else when it's Viresh and Martin?! Challenging but fun, fair cluing, quality clues!</li>
<li><b>Lakshmi Prakash.</b> Wonderful grid Found it tough but very entertaining.</li>
<li><b>Mona Sogal.</b> Wonderful thematic, challenging grid.. please come back with more :). Random Dent reference was extremely cute. Other references are SIMIANS, LEMMA, SLY MICE.</li>
<li><b>Naru.</b> ...  simians, ... are all part of the most powerful computer. Zaphod has a third hand, random number generator powers the heart of gold. 34 clues + 8 modified entries = 42. 42 syllables in the title+preamb. Nice. should have expected it from Viresh.</li>
<li><b>Qrypt On Y X.</b> Martin's pseudonym HITCHHIKER :D. Words like CRY, FUN, SEE, ARM in alternating cells.</li>
<li><b>Ramki Krishnan.</b> Enjoyed the grid. Found the 8 modified entries quite difficult to crack, though the rest of the clues were fairly straightforward. Loved the defs for RECLUSES. THIRD-HAND, SIMIANS, WORDLESSLY were some other favs.</li>
<li><b>R Nagendra Prasad.</b> Tough going.</li>
<li><b>Samit Kallianpur.</b> Very nice grid and theme!</li>
<li><b>silicongent.</b> rather enjoyable. needed quite a bit of staring back and forth to get to the nut. it helped that the twelve-year old had recently read the book to help confirm my hunches. almost a pangram? i think just b and z missing. this caused me much grief since i was sure i had to get b and z in there.</li>
<li><b>Supriya Mithal.</b> Loved this, Viresh and Martin. A clue to the theme is in one of the setters' names so my mind did go there soon enough. Challenging grid but very enjoyable and some really good clues.  I love that 42 has to be the answer to the main Qs. Looking forward to more grids from you both. Fav clues: 1A , 6A, 9A (surface), 15A, 21A, 1D, 7D, 24D.</li>
<li><b>The Void.</b> I spotted "HARMLES[s]" about 3/4 thru. LOL. :-D	A setter called "Hitchhiker", and another that I know is an H2G2 fan, and "Random" in the title? I think I knew the theme before I began. Zaphod's 3rd HAND. "you semi-evolved SIMIAN". "...early 60s SITCOMs". Belcerabons communicate WORDLESSLY. "DRIVING round Hyde Park Corner on a moped".</li>
<li><b>Venkatesan P.</b> Super. Enjoyed the fun.</li>
<li><b>Venkatraghavan S.</b> Super puzzle.</li>
<li><b>Whoami.</b> Total 42 words (34 + 8). 42 syllables in the grid title.</li>
