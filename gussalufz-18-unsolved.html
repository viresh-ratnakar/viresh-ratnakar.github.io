  exolve-prelude:
    <p>
    One clue (23a) is missing, but you should be able to find it by reading
    between lines.
    </p>
    <p>
    Clues for 1d, 24d, 21d, 19d, 22d, 10d, and 26d have been shuffled
    into a table at the start of the Down clues. You can reshuffle them,
    and when you get them in the left-to-right order listed here, you will
    know it. The total number of possible ways to shuffle seven clues (5040)
    might be a bit too high, so, instead of trying randomly, look for hints
    to piece together. Also, solving the other clues would help.
    </p>
  exolve-question: What is the missing clue for 23a? (4,3,1,6)
  exolve-question: What is revealed after shuffling the table of clues properly? (one word)
  exolve-question: What are the two ways in which the above revelation happens? (64)*
