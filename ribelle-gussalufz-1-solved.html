  exolve-preamble:
    <p>
    Upon receiving and solving this puzzle, you must read the chain letters.
    The only chains that count are the substantial ones—ignore any chains
    that are shorter than length three. You must then proceed to join all the
    chain letters to compose your own final letter! If you fail to do this, then
    the &#9673;&#9673;&#9673;&#9673;* god M will be endlessly unfulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
    You may want to keep track of your chain letters by marking/unmarking them
    using the &#128279; button (or by using the keyboard shortcut, [#]). This
    will help you when you compose your final letter.

  exolve-explanations:
    <p><b>Notes</b></p>
    <p>
    This puzzle is a pangram with a twist. All the letters in the set A-Y can
    be found as ninas, in groups of three or more successive letters
    ("chain letters"). These chain letters are laid along the top row, the
    bottom row, and the diagonal that goes from bottom-left to top-right.
    Taken together, these chain letters form the shape, "Z," thereby
    completing the pangram.
    </p>
    <p>
    The cryptic reading of the preamble instructs the solver to form the
    missing "Z" by joining the chain letters (<i>"join all the chain letters to
    compose your own final letter"</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
    The "&#9673;&#9673;&#9673;&#9673;* god M" stands for PANGRAM: you get
    the PANG from an anagram (indicated by the *) of the circled letters,
    and RA is the usual cryptic god. The cryptic reading of the relevant
    preamble sentence is that you need to join the chain letters to compose the
    Z needed to complete the pangram (otherwise the pangram will be
    "endlessly unfulfilled").
    </p>
    <p><b>Results</b></p>
    <p>We ran this puzzle as a fun contest on a few groups, in September/October
    2020. Here are the solvers, named in order. The ordering is based on the
    grid score (151 points) + scores on the two questions (each up to 10
    points), and then by time of submission. The first block of names lists the
    solvers who scored the maximum possible score (171 points).

  <li><b>Samit Kallianpur:</b> Awesome grid! Thoroughly enjoyed it!</li>
  <li><b>Koh Ting Sween Kenny:</b> That was a really mind-blowing puzzle! I honestly didn't expect the "chain letters" part at all till the very end. Awesome clues too! Keep it up, Ribelle and Gussalufz!</li>
  <li><b>R Nagendra Prasad:</b> I could not make out about the chain letters concept </li>
  <li><b>Harish Kamath:</b> No idea for God M. Wiki tells me it's a Mayan deity but the letters I have are P, A, N, G. Grid was nice. Took the longest time to solve 21d. Didn't know 'Castle in Spain' was a term. Went looking for the names of castles in Spain :) Congratulations to you both!</li>
  <li><b>Saki:</b> Lovely puzzle.</li>
  <li><b>Arthomatik:</b> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Then the dazy log jumps over brow of the quick fox. The gazy doll then quickly jumps over and frowns at the box.

  <li><b>Ganesh Nayak:</b> Great grid, and fun puzzle with lovely a-ha moments - thanks!</li>
  <li><b>Almost there:</b> didn't understand the chain letter thing</li>
  <li><b>Mona Sogal:</b> Delightful grid..fun and breezy... favourite clues Ethic and Canoe trip... I could not really get the Spoonerism though!</li>
  <li><b>spiffytrix:</b> excellent xword specially the linking letters aspect. would have loved if the device to arrive at "pangram" also involved some sleuthing without giving the 4 circled letters for gratis. Not a criticism by any means just being greedy so that the fun could have lasted a little longer. allround technically sound clues with some nice storytelling surfaces specially loved 11A & 21D.
    <p style="margin-left:2em;font-style:italic">
      Setters' response:
      We like the way you think. Care to collaborate on a new crossword? :-)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Lakshmi Prakash:</b> Very nice entertaining grid. Loved the bonus questions. My fav clues were Nephew Ocarina and Earlier</li>
  <li><b>Sabitha Satchi:</b> Fun grid. The chain letters seem to be in three sets - though connected: MNO, VWXY, PQRSTU. Not sure I quite understood the two questions 1) Last letter composed or chain composed?  2) I am getting the letters to make up BANG in the circled letters. Anything else then? Fun puzzle nevertheless! Thank you Viresh and Faten!</li>
  <li><b>Dr S Venkatesh:</b> Nice.</li>
  <li><b>Anthony Hope:</b> I don't understand anything about the "chain letters" part of this crossword. I saw your hint on Facebook. I found a long diagonal "chain" of consecutive letter groupings that stretches from bottom-left to top-right. But now what do I do?! This is a very unclear and confusing puzzle! Btw, is 17D correct?</li>
  <li><b>Bhala:</b> Nice creative work in both concept and grid.  A good balance between difficulty and entertainment. Particularly liked clues for OCARINA, BROADSIDE, VENT, REVERIE (a lovely find).  Not sure how SHORTCUT is meant to be parsed. CANOE TRIP is probably ok for a fun puzzle, but non-dictionary entries are generally avoidable. 12a as a CD has many possible answers, needs crossing to fix.  Enjoyable puzzle
    <p style="margin-left:2em;font-style:italic">
      Setters' response:
      The CANOE TRIP was ultimately a choice forced by the special elements of this grid (fairly caught by you!).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>N. Rengaswamy:</b> An enjoyable grid to solve, especially after IXL Round 5 where we found it difficult to annotate a few clues. Nice new concept of letter chain. Could not understand PANG* god M stuff.</li>
  <li><b>Supriya Mithal:</b> I enjoyed the grid , clever and fun ,and of course this software is excellent. I did not get the anno for ALUMNUS. Favourites: ETHIC, BROADSIDE, CANOE TRIP, UNPINNED, REVERIE, PROVERB</li>
  <li><b>Anthony Hope:</b> I still don't fully understand this puzzle! What does "....* god M" mean?!</li>
  <li><b>Krittibas Dasgupta:</b> Found the grid very entertaining, nice smooth cluing. Was a bit confused about what is meant by "chain letters", so Ribelle's timely comment on FB helped a lot. Although, I am not yet sure if I have managed to get all the letters, there's one missing in the chain...</li>
  <li><b>Ashit Hegde:</b> Even without the chain letters, this was a very good puzzle. The chain was the icing on the cake. Takes genius to create a puzzle of this kind</li>
  <li><b>Dr. Srinivas Venkatesh:</b> Nice.</li>
  <li><b>Dumpy Nose:</b> Very Nice!</li>
  <li><b>Himanshu:</b> Very creative, loved solving it</li>
  <li><b>Sabitha Satchi:</b> Fun grid. Found all the chain letters except Z. God M was not clear.</li>
  <li><b>Ramki:</b> Fun puzzle, many nice clues. NEPHEW, REVERIE, OVERALL were favourites.</li>
  <li><b>Narayanan R:</b> excellent, creative and entertaining</li>
  <li><b>Suresh Dorbala:</b> Most enjhoyable puzzle</li>
  <li><b>Veera Raghavan:</b> Nice grid with some challenging clues. Am submitting only the grid. Assuming ABC, DEF etc as chain letters but unable to proceed further.</li>
  <li><b>Anicha:</b> Fun grid and interesting concept. Enjoyed solving it!</li>
