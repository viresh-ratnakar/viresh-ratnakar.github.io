  exolve-prelude:
    <p>
    A 7×7 area at the center of the grid has been cleared completely. Moreover,
    enums for words beginning or ending in this area have been omitted in
    the clues.
    </p>
    <p>
    After filling the grid and identifying all the black
    squares in the central area (press the spacebar to fill a square with
    black), you should be able to put two and two together.
    Putting this discovery next to a preceding word from the neighbourhood
    would give you a famous title.
    </p>
    <p>
    The puzzle also features six interesting
    features of the title, including some leading characters.

  exolve-question: What is the famous title? (5-2) CATCH-22
  exolve-question: Leading characters? (9,12,8,6) YOSSARIAN MINDERBINDER CATHCART NATELY
  exolve-question: Setting? (7) PIANOSA
  exolve-question: Author? (6) HELLER

  exolve-explanations:
    <h3>Explanations</h3>
    <p>
    The black squares in the central area can be seen to form the number “22.”
    Together with 18a (CATCH), they form the novel title, CATCH-22.
    </p>
    <p>
    The “six interesting features of the title, including some leading
    characters” are:
    <ul>
    <li>HELLER (author) and PIANOSA (primary setting) (both ninas)</li>
    <li>YOSSARIAN, MINDERBINDER, CATHCART, NATELY: Acrostically listed
    (“leading characters”) in the clues.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
    This puzzle continues my "visual" theme for the year, in my 1ACross
    crosswords. I was trying to see if I could make any number shapes using
    black squares (while respecting symmetry), and realized that I could make
    the number "22." That immediately suggested using Catch-22 as the theme.
    </p>
    <p>
    Leaving the "22" visible in plain sight seemed too easy. So, I decided to
    make the grid diagramless. But, making the whole 15 &times; 15 grid
    diagramless seemed a bit harsh on solvers. So, I settled for keeping a
    smaller 7 &times; 7 area as diagramless.
    </p>
    <p>
    After hiding a couple of themed ninas, I thought of doing an acrostic in
    the clues, largely as a challenge for myself. My only regret is that the
    6D clue, "Tuna: a fish regularly cooked (3)" could have been a nice
    &amp;lit ("A fish regularly cooked (3)"), but I needed the T at the
    beginning.
