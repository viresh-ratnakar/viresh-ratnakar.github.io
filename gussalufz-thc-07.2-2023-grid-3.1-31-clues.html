    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
Chinese food is the theme of this crossword. The following entries are thematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li>5D &amp; 25D: DIM SUM.</li>
<li>17A &amp; 6A: CHOPSTICKS.</li>
<li>12D &amp; 27A: FORTUNE COOKIE.</li>
<li>3D &amp; 26A: FRIED RICE.</li>
</ul>
<p>
CHOW MEIN can be seen as a nina running down the third
column from the right.
</p>
<p>
The title refers cryptically to a WOK, the source of
many a Chinese delicacy.
</p>
<p>
A good general rule while setting is to avoid repetition
(of indicators, abbreviations, etc.) in a puzzle, as
a repetition is a lost opportunity—solvers would find
variety more interesting. However, in this crossword, I
have chosen to break this rule by using "that is" for IE
in both 2D and 27A. The fact that both the clues are
&amp;lit, and both use "that is" in the same "Yoda-like"
manner should (I hope) convey to the solver that the rule
was broken deliberately for fun.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
Russia's aggression in Ukraine stretches on. It's been
harrowing at times for us, as my brother and his family
live in Ukraine. Through a series of unlikely coincidences,
my niece actually visited us from Lviv a few weeks back, 
for a business trip.
