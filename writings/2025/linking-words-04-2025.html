<h2>Linking Words</h2>
<h4>Gussalufz, April 2025</h4>
</center>

<p>
Some linking words give me pause thought while setting. It's usually because
I've seen someone object to their usage for some reason, and I've either
(a) agreed with that reason or (b) have come up with a counter reason that makes
them OK to use (for me, at least), and I need the pause to figure out whether
it was (a) or (b). This write-up is an attempt to tabulate a whole darn
annotated set of linking words for my own future self (and hopefully other
setters will be able to derive some value as well).
</p>

<p>
A linking word is a word that's inserted between the wordplay part and the
definition part in a cryptic clue. The need typically comes from the surface
reading, but the setter has to make sure that the linking word works well in
the cryptic reading as well. I use the same model as I have described in my
<a href="../2023/cryptic-grammar.html">article on Cryptic Grammar</a>:
the linking word has to work in the sense of the setter observing the wordplay
(in present or present continuous tense) or the setter instructing the
solver to apply the wordplay.
</p>

<p>
For example, the linking word <span class="clue">"from"</span> works
well in this clue:
<blockquote class="clue">Food from a can (4)</blockquote> 
This is because the cryptic reading of the clue, <span class="clue">[definition]
  from [wordplay]</span>, is grammatically correct; it is the setter
telling you that a word for a kind of food (ALOO) can be created <i>from</i>
the wordplay of concatenating A and LOO (can). This linking word only works
in the 
<span class="clue">[definition] from [wordplay]</span>
direction; it cannot be used in the opposite direction,
<span class="clue not-ok">[wordplay] from [definition]</span>.
</p>

<h2>Big Table Of Linking Words That Work Well</h2>

<p>
Here's the main act, a table tabulating some controversial and some
not-so-controversial linking words, alongside a column noting which of
the two directions they work in, and some occasional notes. The tables
can't be and aren't comprehensive (one can always find creative
rephrasings!). They are also not absolute commandments: context-specific
subjective judgement is the ultimate decider, for any setter.
</p>


<table>
  <tr style="color:darkblue">

      <br>
      <span class="clue">[wordplay] and [definition]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      Here's the definition of the solution word, <i>and</i> here's a bit of
      wordplay that creates the same word.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span class="clue">or</span></td>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">[definition] or [wordplay]</span>
      <br>
      <span class="clue">[wordplay] or [definition]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      The solution word can be derived from this definition <i>or</i> from this
      wordplay.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span class="clue">is</span></td>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">[definition] is [wordplay]</span>
      <br>
      <span class="clue">[wordplay] is [definition]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      The solution word <i>is</i> the same as the result of this wordplay.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span class="clue">'s</span></td>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">[definition]'s [wordplay]</span>
      <br>
      <span class="clue">[wordplay]'s [definition]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      Note that the <i>'s</i> is to be read as <i>is</i> in the
      cryptic reading. A common ruse is to have it work as a
      shortening of <i>has</i> in the surface reading.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span class="clue">being</span></td>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">[definition] being [wordplay]</span>
      <br>
      <span class="clue">[wordplay] being [definition]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      This one feels slightly weird, but less so if you imagine
      a comma before the <i>being</i> and think of it as
      <i>definition/wordplay, being the same as wordplay/definition</i>.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span class="clue">from</span></td>

      <br>
      <span class="clue">[wordplay] with [definition]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      The first direction is generally accepted by everyone, but the
      second one is not. If you interpret <i>with</i> as <i>from</i>, then
      the second direction does not work, indeed. But the trick is to see
      the <i>with</i> simply as a conjunction, in the sense of <i>alongside</i>,
      for the cryptic reading to make sense.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><span class="clue">has</span></td>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">[definition] has [wordplay]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      This, in fact, is the origin story for this article.
      A friend (and budding setter) used this construction, and I
      nitpicked initially. But, upon reflection, I felt that this is fine!
      It's the setter observing that the solution word <i>has</i> this
      wordplay. For example:
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="clue">This beach area has raging disease (7)</span>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">displays</span><br>
      <span class="clue">exhibits</span><br>
      <span class="clue">parades</span><br>
      <span class="clue">shows</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">[definition] displays/.../shows [wordplay]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      These are extensions of the <i>has</i> construction. The setter is
      saying that the solution word (with the given definition) exhibits
      the listed wordplay.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">for</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">[wordplay] for [definition]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      This construction only works with instructional wordplay.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">to find</span><br>
      <span class="clue">to get</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">[wordplay] to find/get [definition]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      This construction too only works with instructional wordplay.
    </td>
  </tr>

      <span class="clue">composes</span><br>

      <span class="clue">offers</span><br>

      <span class="clue">yields</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      <span class="clue">[wordplay] becomes/.../yields [definition]</span>
    </td>
    <td>
      The present continuous versions of these
      (<span class="clue">[wordplay] creating [definition]</span>, etc.)
      seem weird to me. But, one can be forgiven to imagine an elided
      <i>is</i> in front of them, if the surface really really needs
      such a form.
      <br>
      <br>
      When the wordplay is presented as an instruction, the infinitive
      forms of these linking words can be used (<i>to create</i>,
      <i>to form</i>, etc.).

    <td>
      <span class="clue not-ok">[definition] upon [wordplay]</span>

    <td>
      For both <i>on</i> and <i>upon</i>, I can see how they can
      work in some restricted scenarios, such as
      <span class="clue">[definition] upon [mixing something]</span>,
      but in those cases, for me it's more natural to think of
      all of <span class="clue">upon mixing</span> as the anagrind,
      without any linking word.
