<h2>Composite Anagrams</h2>
<h4>Gussalufz, April 2022</h4>

<p>
A recent The Hindu Cryptic crossword of mine (THC #13543) featured this clue:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <span class="clue">5d. Saga this distant relative of mine misused for cheap magazines? (10)</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
  This is a "Composite Anagram" (CA, also called a "Compound Anagram") and is considered an
  "advanced" clue type. I say, <i>piffle</i> to that! I think it's quite straightforward, once
  you've worked a few out. It's the only clue type where the definition part can be found
  in the middle of the clue (it can also be at either end, of course).
</p>

<p>
  You can find many explanations on the web, but I think my explanation is better
  (of course :-)). Just like a normal anagram clue, a CA has two parts,
  <span class="clue">X</span> and <span class="clue">Y</span>, and the
  clue's cryptic reading tells you that <span class="clue">X</span> is an
  anagram of <span class="clue">Y</span> (it can do so in a variety of
  ways, like <span class="clue">Angering X gives Y</span>, or <span class="clue">X is Y
  after adjustments</span>, or <span class="clue">X rearranges to Y</span>,
  etc.â€”the point is that the anagrind can be anywhere as long as the cryptic reading is
  grammatical).
</p>

<p>
In a normal anagram clue, one of
  <span class="clue">X</span>/<span class="clue">Y</span>
  <i>is</i> the definition. In a CA, one of
  <span class="clue">X</span>/<span class="clue">Y</span>
  <i>contains</i> the definition as a sub-phrase. It will have other letters (to be
  included literally in the anagramming) before and/or after the definition part.
  It is common to indicate a CA with a <span class="clue">this [definition]</span>,
  or <span class="clue">such a [definition]</span>,
  etc. (but sometimes the setter may not do that and get some raised eyebrows, if the
  surface without <span class="clue">this</span>/<span class="clue">such</span>/etc.
  is just much better).
</p>

<p>
So, in my clue, <span class="clue">X = saga this distant relative of mine</span>,
with <span class="clue">distant relative of mine</span>
being the definition, prefixed by <span class="clue">this</span>. The solution is
<span class="anno">CHIMPANZEE</span>. The anagrind is
<span class="clue">misused</span>.
And, <span class="clue">Y = cheap magazines</span>.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <span class="clue">(SAGA CHIMPANZEE)* = CHEAP MAGAZINES.</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
And that's composite anagramming, decomposed.
