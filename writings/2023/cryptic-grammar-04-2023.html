<h2>Cryptic Grammar</h2>
<h4>Gussalufz, April 2023</h4>
</center>

<p>
A cryptic crossword clue is a pretty weird thing. It’s a sentence fragment that
seems to be saying something, but, upon closer scrutiny, turns out to be saying
a completely different thing, and that too in <i>two</i> ways! What’s going on!?
</p>

<p>
I like to think of it as a conversation between the setter and the solver. The
setter picks a grid, fills it with words, and then invents an interesting way
to arrive at the sequence of letters in each word. The setter then presents these
inventions in plain English to the solver after affixing definitions of the
solution words, in a fun way that creates sentence fragments that seem to
obfuscate their true intents. The solver takes on each clue and tries to
recover its true intent. There is much chuckling on both sides.

In this playful contract between the cryptic crossword setter and the cryptic
crossword solver, the expectation is that each clue can be applauded in two
distinct ways:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The <b>surface reading</b> of the clue is <i>interesting</i>. Here are
    some possible ways for that:
    <ol>
      <li>
        It is <i>funny,</i> or, <i>shocking,</i> or <i>profound,</i> or tugs
        compellingly at some other emotion.
      </li>
      <li>
        It says something quite <i>plausible</i> or <i>natural,</i> something
        that does not seem to be a cryptic clue at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is <i>weird,</i> maybe even <i>nonsensical,</i> but in some nice,
        catchy, vivid way.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>cryptic reading</b> of the clue clearly describes wordplay
    manipulations that lead to the solution, and begins or ends with a
    definition part that also leads to the solution. Ideally, it passes
    muster on <i>all</i> these counts:
    <ol>
      <li>
        The wordplay recipe as well as the definition is
        <i>precise,</i> once parsed correctly.
      </li>
      <li>
        The wordplay recipe is <i>fair,</i> adhering to some commonly
        agreed-upon norms (such as no extraneous words, no indirect anagrams,
        etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
        The cryptic reading of the clue is <i>grammatically correct.</i>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
In this piece, I will focus on 2.3. (cryptic grammar), which is unfortunately an
oft-overlooked aspect. Parsing out the cryptic reading correctly is a big part
of the fun for the solver, and if that reading turns out to be grammatically
incorrect, then it can be a let-down. Fortunately, it’s not that hard to check
and get right, as we shall see here.
</p>

<p>
The cryptic wordplay recipe, once teased out correctly from the clue, should be
a grammatically correct English statement that generally takes one of the
following forms.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Assertive present tense forms:
    <ul>
      <li>
        This manipulation happens and then that shenanigan is carried out and
        then this scrambled word is added, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        This phrase contains ...
      </li>
      <li>
        This manipulation is happening and then that shenanigan is getting
        carried out and then this reversal is being performed, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        This container has taken in this fodder, etc. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Imperative directions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do this manipulation and scramble this word and also add this or
        substitute that, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The above clue forms are in line with the model of the setter coming up with
inventions leading to the make-up of each word and then presenting these
inventions to the solver. Let’s look at nuances and gotchas using a few
Gussalufz clues as illustrative examples. Consider the following Down clue:
</p>

<blockquote class="clue">
Women who criticized menu finish up noodles (4)
</blockquote>

<p>
The solution is <span class="anno">UDON</span>, obtained by reversing the last
letters of the first four words. The surface reading is grammatically correct,
but can we say the same about the cryptic reading? Clearly not. This is a
flagrant example of the problem, but one that I would like to use to introduce
a trick that can be used to help with checking the cryptic grammar.
</p>

<p>
Here’s the trick: to see past the surface distractions and look at the cryptic
reading directly, mentally replace the wordplay fodder part(s) with
placeholders such as <span class="clue">[fodder]</span> (or <span
class="clue">[fodder-1]</span>, <span class="clue">[fodder-2]</span>,
<span class="clue">[fodder-for-up]</span>,
<span class="clue">[X]</span>,
<span class="clue">[Y]</span>,
<span class="clue">[Z]</span>,
etc.). While at it, also replace the
definition part with <span class="clue">[solution]</span>. If there are no
connecting words between the wordplay part and the definition part, then
insert an equals sign between these two parts. So, your
mental model of the above clue’s cryptic reading, shorn of surface distractions,
becomes:
</p>

<blockquote class="clue">
[Fodder-1] [fodder-2] [fodder-3] [fodder-4] finish up = [solution] (4)
</blockquote>

<p>
Ah, there are four foddery thingies here, and the word
<span class="clue">finish</span> is not the
grammatically correct way to refer to their four last letters—we need the
plural form, <span class="clue">finishes</span>. Of course, merely changing the
indicator word to its plural form would wreak havoc on the surface grammar, so
we need a small additional modification: let’s change
<span class="clue">Women</span> to <span class="clue">Woman</span>:
</p>

<blockquote class="clue">
Woman who criticized menu finishes up noodles (4)
</blockquote>

<p>
There are a few additional points about this "trick" that I would like to
cover. The idea is to bring out the cryptic reading clearly. You should
feel free to come up with your own conventions for doing that. But I'll
spell out my own here for reference.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Retain all indicator words and connecting words exactly as they are. The
    whole point is to check their syntactic validity when all the fodder terms
    are exposed.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a wordplay component is a synonym (or a hypernym or a
    definition-by-example), replace it with the actual synonym (ot hypernym,
    etc.). If writing it down, maybe do it disinctively, in spelled-out
    uppercase letters. The idea is to think of it as merely a sequence of
    letters, ignoring its meaning. Of course, you can go one step further and
    replace it with <span class="clue">[fodder]</span>, but I like to keep it
    spelled out distinctively to additionally guard against it getting used in,
    say further (indirect) anagramming. You can see this with the definition
    <span class="clue">endeavour</span> in the next example, that I have
    converted to its solution, <span class="CLUE">T-R-Y</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are cases where an indicator itself acts as a connecting word
    or phrase between the definition and the wordplay. For example,
    <span class="clue">Great in sex, tremendous! (7)</span>. In such
    cases, obviously, we don't need to insert an equals sign between
    the definition and wordplay (so, we'll read it as
    <span class="clue">[Solution] in [fodder-1], [fodder-2]! (7)</span>).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The next example has a slightly more subtle problem:
</p>

<blockquote class="clue">
Bank's endeavour to keep a user in confusion (8)
</blockquote>

<p>
The solution is <span class="anno">TREASURY (TRY around AUSER*)</span>. The
cryptic reading seems OK... or, is it? This clue uses the common trick of
having <span class="clue">'s</span> mean one thing in the surface reading
(where, in this case, it acts in the possessive sense) and another thing in
the cryptic reading (where it stands for "is"). Let’s spell out the cryptic
reading:
</p>

<blockquote class="clue">
[Solution] is T-R-Y to keep [fodder] in confusion (8)
</blockquote>

<p>
This is grammatically flawed, a fact that is revealed clearly once the "is" is
spelled out. The right form would be <span class="clue">[Solution] is T-R-Y,
keeping [fodder]*</span>. A slight change in punctuation works better for the
surface in my opinion, so my final version is:
</p>

<blockquote class="clue">
Bank's endeavour: keeping a user in confusion (8)
</blockquote>
 
<p>
To summarize, my suggestion is to examine the cryptic reading (every clause in
it, as well as the whole thing) in its bare grammatical essence, by mentally
replacing parts of the clue with placeholder terms such as <span
class="clue">[fodder]</span>, <span class="clue">[XYZ]</span>, <span
class="clue">[solution]</span>, etc. While on the topic of placeholders, I
would like to add that I find a very similar strategy to be very useful in
crafting nice, coherent surfaces: I may start my clue’s draft with a
placeholder term for the wordplay indicator, such as, <span class="clue">Bank’s
  endeavour, keeping a user anagrinding</span>. At least for me, starting from
this partial state works better for the gray cells, priming them nicely to
conjure up good candidates for replacing <span class="clue">anagrinding</span>
that work well with the rest of the surface.
</p>

<p>
Let’s look at one more example.
</p>

<blockquote class="clue">
Police officer probes the woman about dates (6)
</blockquote>

<p>
The solution is <span class="anno">EPOCHS (COP in SHE, reversed)</span>. The
cryptic reading is, <span class="clue">C-O-P probes S-H-E about =
[solution]</span>. The problem here is that the wordplay part starts off in
the present tense with <span class="clue">probes</span>, and <span class="clue">C-O-P probes
S-H-E</span> is not a noun phrase that can be seen as getting reversed
with the <span class="clue">about</span> suffix. To make sense of the reversal requires a
substantial piece of patchwork to be imagined as having been elided (something like,
<span class="clue">C-O-P probes S-H-E
<span class="elision">and turns</span> about =
[solution]</span>). A simpler construction, one that clearly works grammatically,
is obtained by using the present participle form,
<span class="clue">probing</span>, as that allows us to
think of <span class="clue">C-O-P probing S-H-E</span> as a noun
phrase, and we just have to imagine a missing comma: <span
class="clue">C-O-P probing S-H-E<span class="elision">,</span> about = [solution]</span>.
</p>

<blockquote class="clue">
Police officer probing the woman about dates (6)
</blockquote>

<p>
A few final tips that might be helpful in keeping the cryptic reading
grammatically correct:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Fodder consisting of a single word should be thought of in the singular. Fodder
consisting of multiple words can be interpreted in the plural (<span
  class="clue">A, B anagrind</span> = <i>"these words anagrind"</i>) as well as
singular (<span class="clue">A, B, C anagrinds</span> = <i>"this group of words
  anagrinds"</i>)—except that if there is something like a connecting <span
  class="clue">and</span> (as in, <span class="clue">A and B anagrind</span>), then
only the plural interpretation makes sense.
</li>
<li>
When there is a connecting word or phrase between the definition and the
wordplay, it should connect the two parts in the sense of implying that the
wordplay leads to the solution or the solution is derived from the wordplay. A
common error, easily exposed by using the placeholder trick, is the
construction <span class="clue">[Wordplay] of/from [solution]</span>.
</li>
<li>
Ideally, the punctuation marks already in the clue (for its surface reading)
should fit perfectly in the cryptic reading as well. But in moderation, it’s OK
to expect the solver to imagine an extra comma or ignore a hyphen, when parsing
out the cryptic reading.
</li>
<li>
While not every setter agrees with this, in my opinion, the cryptic reading
does not work if the wordplay recipe is in the past tense.
<blockquote>
  <span
  class="clue">[Wordplay] happened
  <span class="elision">and left behind (for us to see) the</span>
  [solution]</span>?
</blockquote>
I think not; that’s not how a setter would present their own
inventions, their own discoveries (Einstein would not have presented
his work as <b>E <i>equalled</i> mc<sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup></b>).
Of course, it is perfectly fine and common to use indicator verbs
in the past tense as adjectives in the cryptic reading, such as in <span
class="clue">Boiled pasta for a quick meal (5)</span>, where the surface
reading of the clue might be in the past tense.
</li>
<li>
Sometimes, grammatical correctness can be subjective, as some people might be
more willing than others to imagine long elisions that would fix the issue.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let’s turn this around now. Each of the following clues has a flawed cryptic
reading, in my opinion. Can you find the flaws and come up with fixes?
</p>

<ol>
  <li><span class="clue">Snowflakes perhaps whine and start shedding salt tears (8)</span></li>
  <li><span class="clue">Cancellation of date’s certain (7)</span></li>
  <li><span class="clue">Strip, subjugate husband with extremely lascivious poetry (7)</span></li>
  <li><span class="clue">Communicates goodbye after ending encounter (6)</span></li>
  <li><span class="clue">Conflict with lover suspicious to some extent (6)</span></li>
  <li><span class="clue">Doctor cures poor father? Is expected (3,3,3,6)</span></li>
</ol>
