    Solutions to four Down clues have a common element that's
called out by the title. These solutions are also the
definitions for four other special Down clues that do not
include definitions. Solutions to these special Down
clues have to be entered in the grid in a cryptic manner.
Enumerations shown in these special clues are for the grid
entries, not for the solutions. When finished, the phrase
formed by the circled letters will also confirm what you
did.
    </p>
  exolve-explanations:
    <p>
The four Down solutions that <i>“have a common element
that's called out by the title”</i> are: 4d (DAMAGED),
9d (SECOND), 14d (SUPPRESSED), and 19d (RAISED).
The common element is that they all end with the letter D
(and are the only Down solutions to do so). The phrase
<i>“called out by the title”</i> refers to the
fact that the title sounds like “D-termination”.
</p>
<p>
The four other special Down clues that need to use the above
four entries as their solutions are: 1d, 8d, 18d, and 21d.
These are wordplay-only clues, and their solutions are as
follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> 1d. RUNNERS-UP (definition: SECOND).</li>
<li> 8d. BOTTLED UP (definition: SUPPRESSED).</li>
<li> 18d. BROUGHT UP (definition: RAISED).</li>
<li> 21d. SCREWED UP (definition: DAMAGED).</li>
</ul>
<p>
These four special solutions <i>“have to be entered
in the grid in a cryptic manner,”</i> say the
instructions. Each one is of the form
“[...] UP,” and is entered in a rebus-like
manner, using just the letters in the [...] part in reverse
(<i>up!</i>).
</p>
<p>
The instructions conclude by saying, <i>“When finished,
the phrase formed by the circled letters will also confirm
what you did.”</i> When you've finished the puzzle
correctly, the circled letters form the phrase
“USED UP,” which is what you did to enter the
four special solutions. Additionally, <i>“when
finished”</i> also refers to the fact that the phrase
“USED UP” means “finished.”
</p>
<p>
This crossword was published in the July 2023 edition of
<i>1 Across</i> magazine. In the published version, the
editor chose to use different versions of the clues for 23D
and 25D ("... as the overt sexual references are just far too much"). Here are the published version of those clues:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
23D. Revolutionary author, engaged in it, is clumsy (5)</li>
<li>25D. Coupled with more in France (4)</li>
</ul>
