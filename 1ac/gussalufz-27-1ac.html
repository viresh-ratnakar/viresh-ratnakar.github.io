    Each across clue omits one or more letters from its
    wordplay. Figure out a few ways to connect and recover
    the missing links.
    </center>
    </p>
  exolve-explanations:
    <p>
The preamble says:
</p><blockquote>
<i>
Figure out a few ways to connect and recover the missing
links.
</i>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
This should be parsed as:
</p><blockquote>
<i>Figure out a few ways to connect
and [thereby!] recover the missing links.</i>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
Consecutive letters at the beginning or end of
the solution have been omitted from the wordplay in
each across clue. The sequence of omissions in each across
clue forms one of two parts of a nina
going over two across lights. Each such nina is
"a way to connect" in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It connects two across lights in the grid.</li>
<li>It's a word synonymous with "a way to connect."</li>
</ul>
<p>
While at first glance the surface of 1D might seem a bit
random, it is actually asking solvers to work with beaten
(i.e., solved) down clues to find the missing links.
