    There are eight numbers hidden in this grid, some running over from one solution to
    another and one being a two-letter Roman numeral. These numbers creatively add up
    to another number.
    </center>
    </p>
  exolve-explanations:
    The eight hidden numbers are:

<ul>
<li>4: Unchecked cells in the 12th column.</li>
<li>5: Unchecked cells in the 2nd column.</li>
<li>6: 18A.</li>
<li>8: Embedded in 28A.</li>
<li>9: Embedded (as IX) in 18A.</li>
<li>10: Straddles 12A and 13A.</li>
<li>11: Straddles 29A and 30A.</li>
<li>20: Unchecked cells in the 6th column.</li>
</ul>

The eight letters in the cells that have these numbers can be jumbled to create another number: FORTY-TWO. The number 42 is the answer to the "ultimate question" in <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> books. The ultimate question itself is revealed to be the opening line in the Bob Dylan song, <i>Blowin' in the Wind</i>: How many roads must a man walk down?
