    The two wacky headlines above have two missing
    words each. In both, the first word can be found via a
    puzzle and the second word from a nina.
    </p>
    <p>
    This puzzle was published in the
    <a href='https://1across.org'>1ACross blog</a>
    in January 2019.

  exolve-question: Rogue ?????????? Break ??????? (10,7) PUPPETEERS STRINGS
  exolve-question: Nose At War: ?????? Concoction ?????? (6,6) EGGNOG STINKS

  exolve-explanations:
    <h3>Explanations</h3>
    <p>
    The ninas are: STRINGS, STINKS.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the top-left and the bottom-right, there are two 4×4 “15 Puzzles.” The
    letters in the first 15 Puzzle can be scrambled (as indicated by “Break”) to
    “Rogue PUPPETEERS.” The letters in the second 15 Puzzle can be scrambled (as
    indicated by “Concoction”) to “Nose At War: EGGNOG.” Filling the ninas
    in completes the two wacky headlines:
    <blockquote>
    Rogue Puppeteers Break Strings<br/>
    Nose At War: Eggnog Concoction Stinks
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
    I think the “endgame” in this puzzle is quite simple if the solver is
    familiar with what a “15 puzzle” is. Here’s the Wikipedia link:
    <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle
    </a>. Perhaps most folks have actually played with a 15 puzzle, but some
    may not be familiar with its name. As an aside, the 15 puzzle is usually
    solved in raster order (left-to-right and top-to-bottom), but there is
    another way that is mathematically cute: get the top row and the left
    column right, and now you have reduced the 4×4 puzzle to a 3×3 puzzle.
    Repeat the same reduction strategy!
