  exolve-prelude:
    <p>
    One clue (23a) is missing, but you should be able to find it by reading
    between lines.
    </p>
    <p>
    Clues for 1d, 24d, 21d, 19d, 22d, 10d, and 26d have been shuffled
    into a table at the start of the Down clues. You can reshuffle them,
    and when you get them in the left-to-right order listed here, you will
    know it. The total number of possible ways to shuffle seven clues (5040)
    might be a bit too high, so, instead of trying randomly, look for hints
    to piece together. Also, solving the other clues would help.
    </p>
  exolve-question: What is the missing clue for 23a? (4,3,1,6) WORK FOR A SUMMER
  exolve-question: What is revealed after shuffling the table of clues properly? (one word) ALGEBRA
  exolve-question: What are the two ways in which the above revelation happens? (64)* First letters of clues, also Greek labels, in the given order

    <p>
      <b>Notes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    This is my first barred grid. The grid-fill was challenging, even with
    software (qxw) help!
    </p>
    The hint in the preamble ("you should be able to find it by reading between
    <i>lines</i>") alludes cryptically to the fact that the clue for 23a is a
    nina found between separator bars in the grid.
    </p>
    <p>
    When you arrange the clues in the table at the end of the Down clues
    correctly in order, their first letters spell the word ALGEBRA (as is
    hinted in the instruction, "... look for <i>hints</i> to piece together").
    Their greek labels also spell ALGEBRA (Alpha Lambda Gamma Epsilon Beta Rho
    Alpha).
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition to MATHEMATICS and ALGEBRA being hidden in the puzzle, the
    surfaces of 5a, 38a, 6d, and 34d have themes related to mathematics.
