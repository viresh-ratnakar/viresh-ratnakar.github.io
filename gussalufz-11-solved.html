  exolve-prelude:
    <p>
    Please look for the following as you solve this puzzle:
    <blockquote>
        (a) Letter with Nina’s shape.<br/>
        (b) Number of the second word ending in Nina’s initials.<br/>
        (c) Number of the first word ending in Nina’s initials.<br/>
        (d) Nina.
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
    JOIN the above ANSWERS  to fill the blanks in the phrase:
    <blockquote>
    ??? ???????? ???????? instructions
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
    Do an internet search on this phrase to find a set of instructions.
    Some of the instructions thus found can be used to fill in the three-letter
    parts that are left unclued in the wordplay in all the clues for words that
    do not touch Nina.
    </p>
    <p>
    Only three such three-letter parts are used as fillers in all those clues.
    The nine letters from these three fillers can be jumbled to complete the
    following sentence:
    <blockquote>
    Products that worked with the above used to have this ????: ????? inside.
    </blockquote>

  exolve-question: Fill in the blanks (??? ???????? ???????? instructions) (3,8,8) X86 ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE
  exolve-question: Solution for the end puzzle (... this ????: ????? inside) (4,5) SEAL INTEL

  exolve-explanations:
    <h3>Explanations</h3>
    <p>
    Nina: ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    (a) Letter with Nina’s shape is X.<br/>
    (b) The number of the second word ending in AL (EXTERNAL) is 8.<br/>
    (c) The number of the first word ending in AL (CHORAL) is 6.<br/>
    (d) Nina is Assembly Language.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Putting these four components together, with the word “instructions” added,
    gives us the phrase: X86 Assembly Language instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a little research will easily show, the X86 Assembly Language is a
    low-level computer programming language used in the X86 class of
    microprocessors, a milestone in computing. The missing “instructions” are
    literally instructions drawn from the computer instruction set used in this
    language. The prelude helpfully calls for an internet search for
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=X86+Assembly+Language+instructions"
    >X86 Assembly Language instructions</a>, and the very first result leads to
    the needed list of instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are only four words in the puzzle that do not intersect with the
    nina: 15a, 19a, 5d, and 26d. As noted in the puzzle prelude, only three
    three-letter parts are needed to be picked from the x86 instruction set.
    These three are: INT (used twice), LEA, LES. See annotations for 15a, 19a,
    5d, and 26d below. The letters INT LEA LES can be jumbled to complete the
    sentence:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    Products that worked with the above used to have this SEAL: INTEL inside.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>
    I had created a few grids earlier with ninas running across or down. For
    this grid, i thought I would do a nina that went diagonally. There are two
    diagonals, and I then figured I would fill them both with ninas. For a 15×15
    grid with the top-left and bottom-left corners not being black, both nina
    words running diagonally would have 8 letters. I searched for phrases with
    the enum (8,8), looking for something interesting. I liked ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE
    when I saw it in the list.
    </p>

    <p>
    I assembled and filled the grid, with ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE as the nina
    occupying the X shape made by the diagonals. The phrase “assembly language”
    and the “X” triggered “X86” for me. I looked at the words starting at the
    squares numbered 8 and 6 and, by a happy coincidence, both of them ended in
    AL, the initials of “Assembly Language”.
    </p>

    <p>
    Greedily, I wanted more masala.
    </p>

    <p>
    I noticed that the nina touched almost every word in the grid—all but four
    words, in fact. So, I figured, I could treat these four words in some
    special way. I don’t remember exactly how the final part came about: I
    would like to think that at this point I simply came up with the
    realization that I could use x86 assembly language instructions in these
    four words. It’s more likely, though, that I had internet-searched
    “x86 assembly language” for ideas, brought up the instruction set, and then
    had come up with the idea of leaving three-letter parts unclued in those
    four words, using the x86 instruction set. I do remember that I had to
    modify the grid-fill slightly as a couple of those four words did not have
    three-letter x86 instructions embedded in them. But four-letter words are
    forgiving and flexible!
    </p>

    <p>
    I also wanted to “close the loop”—I wanted to create some meta element that
    would confirm/reinforce the special treatment of the four words. It was
    natural to try to jumble the three-letter instructions that were the
    unclued parts. I wanted to get something connected to “x86 assembly
    language,” and “intel seal” presented itself nicely. It’s not a well-known
    phrase though, but, luckily, weaving it into a reasonably natural sentence
    involving the well-known phrase, “intel inside,” was not too hard.
