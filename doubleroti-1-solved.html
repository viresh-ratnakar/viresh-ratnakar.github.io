    Note: This puzzle appears in a science fiction novel. Some of the clue
    surfaces use terms that only make sense in the context of the novel. These
    are the novel-specific terms: "Escher" is an online virtual reality space,
    "Mirzakhani" is a data center, and "mplants" are implants that connect the
    brain to the Net.

    Solution to the puzzle posed in the title: 1729
    </p>
    <p>
    19 ("All-time number" as ALL-TIME is the solution to 19 down) x 91
    ("itself played back many times" is 91 many times) = 1729.

    Solution to the puzzle posed in the prelude: 1729
    </p>
    <p>
    Ramanujan (“Occupant of prime properties”—the prime-numbered squares,
    highlighted in blue above, have the letters RAMANUJAN) was able to make
    some remarkable observations about one taxicab (“Nina”—TAXICAB) using this
    license: 1729 (this was the license number of the taxicab that led to the
    mathematical generalization of “Taxicab numbers” or
    “Hardy-Ramanujan numbers” after Ramanujan observed that it is the smallest
    integer that can be expressed in two different ways as the sum of two
    cubes: 1729 = 1<sup>3</sup> + 12<sup>3</sup> = 9<sup>3</sup> +
    10<sup>3</sup>).
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally, 2 down is a thematic clue whose surface could be interpreted
    as referring to Hardy’s championing of Ramanujan.
