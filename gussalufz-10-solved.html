  exolve-title: King's Rule
  exolve-setter: Gussalufz
  exolve-copyright: 2018 Viresh Ratnakar
  exolve-width: 15
  exolve-height: 15

  exolve-prelude:
  <p>
  This king's rule was quite arbitrary (it aimed to exclude a rapidly growing
  class of population and it was successfully resisted in court). Revealed here,
  first in bits and later fully spelled out, by two Ninas.
  </p>
  <p>
  The successful resister is to be found roughly at 3, 7, 83/7, 13, 23.
  </p>

  exolve-question: What are the two ninas? (?) 101010, FORTY-TWO
  exolve-question: What’s the connection of the Ninas to the title and the prelude to the puzzle? (?) Rule 42 in Alice...
  exolve-question: Who is the successful resister? (5) ALICE

  exolve-nina: c15 e15 g15 i15 k15 m15
  exolve-nina: a5 c5 e5 g5 i5 k5 m5 o5
  exolve-nina: g15 b14 g12 a10 e6

  exolve-explanations:
    <p>
    The first Nina is 101010, which is 42 in binary (in “bits”—i.e., “binary
    digits”).
    </p>
    <p>
    The second Nina is FORTY-TWO, which is 42, “fully spelled out.”
    </p>
    <p>
    The connection of the Ninas to the title/prelude is that Rule 42, as
    proclaimed by the king of hearts in <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i>,
    said: “All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.” This
    arbitrary rule was intended to be used by the king to evict Alice, who had
    been rapidly growing in height (hence “it aimed to exclude a rapidly
    growing class of population”). The puzzle prelude refers to “<i>this</i>
    king’s <i>rule</i>” rather than “<i>this king</i>’s rule.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Alice resisted the rule and did not leave the court. ALICE is indeed the
    “successful resister” located “roughly” at squares 3, 7, 83/7, 13, 23. Here
    83/7 is 11<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>, identifying the 6th of the 7
    white squares spanning
    positions beyond 11 upto 12. The letters at these five locations,
    respectively, are ICLAE. Anagramming them, as indicated by “roughly,”
    yields ALICE. I expect many solvers to figure out ALICE first and then work
    their way backwards to see what “King’s Rule” refers to.
    </p>
    <p>
    The number 42, of course, is also the answer to the ultimate question of
    life, the universe, and everything, in <i>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the
    Galaxy</i> and its sequel novels. Most clue surfaces in this puzzle (all
    but 8a, 11a, 14a, 27a, 3d, 16d, 17d, 19d, 24d) refer to these books.
    “DNA”—used in a couple of clues—are the initials of Douglas Noel Adams, the
    late author of these gems.

    Additional Notes (contain spoilers for the HHGTTG books)
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><i>13a. Zillionaire Zaphod retreated embracing a Caucasian person
    (5).</i> Zaphod Beeblebrox left a party with Tricia McMillan, aka Trillian,
    who then left earth with Zaphod before earth got destroyed by the
    Vogons.</li>
    <li><i>18a. Gogrilla M., entrepreneur bearing regret (6).</i> Gogrilla
    Mincefriend was an entrepreneur who re-invented the staircase when
    prescient elevators refused to move as they were often terrified of what
    lay in store.</li>
    <li><i>30a. Draw world like Lamuella, suited well to idyllic, laid-back
    terminations (8).</i> Lamuella is an idyllic planet where Arthur Dent
    spends time as an excellent Sandwich Maker. The planet seems like a nice
    place to spend one’s final days.</li>
    <li><i>1d. Charge with abduction I, Zem, unmasked (6).</i> Zem (a sentient
    mattress) is the only witness to the abduction of Marvin by the Krikkit war
    robots.</li>
    <li><i>4d. True, Stavro Mueller finishes ailing all over the place (8).</i>
    The event at Stavro Mueller Beta, a nightclub in London, ends the lives of
    all remaining survivors of earth’s destruction by the Vogons.</li>
    <li><i>5d. Representative rewired Colin after removing the last bit of
    towel, getting InfiniDim credit openings (6).</i> Colin was a flying
    security robot, trapped using a towel by Ford Prefect. Ford rewired Colin
    to get free InfiniDim credit card payments. This was a long clue and the
    surface only makes sense if one knows this obscure part from the books. I
    had proposed a slightly simplified rewrite that did not make it:
    <i>Representative rewired Colin after removing the last bit of towel, I
    see (6).</i></li>
    <li><i>10d. Hotblack Desiato demise is to block a redistribution (5).</i>
    Hotblack Desiato, a rich rockstar, indeed spent a year dead for tax
    reasons.</li>
    <li><i>16d. The extent to which rock can absorb pop? Limitless! So, I try,
    desperately (8).</i> This was another long clue with a clunky surface. I
    had an alternate clue lined up, that also did not make it: <i>The difference
    between hard and soft rock? (8)</i></li>
    <li><i>23d. DNA is back after adding top record-breaking "Restaurant at the
    End of the Universe" to trip! (6).</i> I was happy to get the entire title
    of one of the HHGTTG books into the clue.</li>
    <li><i>26d. Sperm whale starts yearning for change of direction (6).</i>
    The Magrathean sperm whale, created mid-air by the Infinite Improbability
    Drive, had a short life span of about a minute before it hit the ground
    and died. It probably did yearn for a change of direction.</li>
