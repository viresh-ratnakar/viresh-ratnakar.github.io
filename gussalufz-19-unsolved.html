  exolve-prelude:
    <p>
    Wormholes can connect far-flung points in space. There are five wormholes
    in this grid. Wormhole hoppers land on the blue circular portals of these
    wormholes and then emerge and continue from the orange circular portals
    (possibly switching from across to down or vice versa in the transition).
    </p>
    <p>
    Once a wormhole hopper is filled in correctly in the grid, the Manhattan
    distance between the pair of portals for that wormhole will automatically
    get displayed in a slot above the first question. These numbers point to
    the traveller within that question, overlooking space.
    </p>
