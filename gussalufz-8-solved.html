  exolve-explanations:
    <p>
    The solution to the question posed in the title (“Do Squares Reveal…?”) is
    PARTY, revealed by the locations in the grid that are “squares”:
    1 (1<sup>2</sup>), 4 (2<sup>2</sup>), 9 (3<sup>2</sup>), 16 (4<sup>2</sup>),
    and 25 (5<sup>2</sup>).
    </p>
    <p>
    Four of the clues use “drink” as the definition, to go along with this
    PARTY theme. These four clues are located in two pairs of symmetric
    locations.
    </p>
    <p>
    This puzzle is a pangram.
    </p>
    <p>
    The originally version of this crossword had 24a as:
    <blockquote>
    24 Mix final party drink (6)
    </blockquote>
    I've revised it as that version used "final ...X = X," a construct
    that I've stopped using. Moreover, using PARTY within a clue was
    not a good idea, it being the nina.
    Original versions of some more clues that were revised:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2d. Settled attack formation rioted, hard to explain (7)</li>
      <li>7a. Tough group Hillary exposed (6)</li>
      <li>20d. Value of Reverend's wire transfer, say (5)</li>
    </ul>
