  exolve-preamble:
    <p>
    If you are a relative newcomer to cryptic crosswords, please feel free to
    click on "Reveal this" for any clue that resists you for too long, to see
    its solution along with a detailed explanation. You may also find the list
    of some commonly used abbreviations listed in the footnote<sup>†</sup>
    useful.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once you have finished solving the puzzle, please do take another look at
    the filled grid to see if you can spot an extra message.
    </p>
    <p>
    The "Check all" button will reveal all solutions and some extra notes
    if the grid has been filled correctly. The "Reveal all" button will
    unconditionally reveal the solutions and the extra notes.
    </p>

  exolve-explanations:
    <p>
    <b>Notes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The theme of the puzzle is my hometown: Los Altos, California. The title
      of the puzzle, "LAST SOLO," is an anagram of "LOS ALTOS."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following clue surfaces or solutions are thematic:
      <ul>
        <li>The solution to 14a is HEIGHTS ("Los Altos" in Spanish means
            "the heights").</li>
        <li>The surface reading of 2d refers to Steve Wozniak, who did some of
            the early work for Apple in Los Altos, with Steve Jobs.</li>
        <li>The surface reading of 6d refers to Berry Ave.</li>
        <li>The surface reading of 13d refers to Main Street.</li>
        <li>The surface reading of 23d refers to Shoup Park.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a thematic "nina" in the grid (i.e., a hidden message
      revealed by looking at some formation of letters from the grid). If
      you read the letters in the squares in the top row and the bottom
      row in sequence, they spell out the words WE LOVE LOS ALTOS.
