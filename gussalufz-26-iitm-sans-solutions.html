      <b><i>Restoring Balance in STEM</i></b> is the theme of
      <b><a href="https://www.iitmaa.org/campusfeed/12370"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sangam
      2021</a></b>.
      The title of this cryptic crossword can be interpreted
      as <i>"restoring"</i> BALANCE IN STEM. As you solve
      the puzzle, you may run into the theme a few more times.
      Circled letters in the completed puzzle can be rearranged to
      constitute the name of a famous champion of <b>balance</b>.
      Two other famous names can be found elsewhere, both
      exemplifying <b>balance in STEM</b>.

  exolve-explanations:
    <center><b>Notes</b></center>
    <p>
      There is a lot of room for improving <b>balance</b> in society;
      particularly so in <b>STEM</b> fields, where basic
      equality is often inaccessible to women and to people from
      oppressed castes, because of systemic problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASS CEILING is a term often applied to such systemic
      problems, and that's the solution to this bonus clue:
      <blockquote>
        A couple of girls discussed closing
        <span class="xlv-definition">unseen barrier</span> (5,7)
        <br>
        <span class="xlv-anno-text" style="color:darkgreen">G LASS {a couple of girls} CEILING {homophone of
        ("discussed ...") SEALING = closing}.</span>
      </blockquote>
      The following solution entries are thematic for <b>balance</b>:
      <blockquote>
        1a: EQUALITY.
        1d: ETHICAL.
        11a: BALANCE.
        21a: ROLES.
        23a: ME TOO.
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following solution entries are thematic for <b>STEM</b>
      (starred ones have thematic surfaces as well):
      <blockquote>
        4d: TESLA*.
        7d: SONAR*.
        13a: WIRED.
        17d: POLYTHENE.
        19a: STEM.
        25d: OZONE*.
        28a: CAPACITOR*.
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the "electromagnetic" surface of 6d is
      STEM-themed. The surface of 12a refers to the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set">Cantor
      set</a>, a fascinating mathematical structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "champion of balance" whose name is "constituted" by
      rearranging the circled letters is the brilliant architect
      of the constitution of India, <b>B. R. AMBEDKAR</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The puzzle celebrates two Indian women who
      overcame systemic challenges and are seen as pioneers in
      their STEM fields. Their names are hidden as ninas
      in the grid: botanist <b><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/pioneering-female-botanist-who-sweetened-nation-and-saved-valley-180972765/">JANAKI
      AMMAL</a></b> (10th column from the left and 6th row
      from the top) and meteorologist <b><a href="https://www.thebetterindia.com/83063/anna-mani-scientist-meteorology-ozone-wind-energy/">ANNA
      MANI</a></b> (2nd row from the bottom).
    </p>
    <p>
      This puzzle is a pangram (i.e., all 26 letters of the
      alphabet get used in the solution words, achieving another
      balance of sorts).

      <li><b>Naru:</b> Nice and easy, more on the easy side, but thoroughly enjoyable.</li>
      <li><b>Fran Gipani:</b> Wonderful grid! Great clues! Thank you!</li>
      <li><b>The Void:</b> 27 was mean to non-cricket fans, but I like it! :-) Other faves: 10, 12, 30, 3, 4.</li>
      <li><b>Saras VI Wing 1994:</b> Thank you for the relevant, lovely and enjoyable crossword Gussalufz! We are Roopesh Mathur and Tapan Agrawal, living in Boston and London, respectively. We used to solve the Hindu and Express crosswords daily at IITM in our hostel wing. Now we solve crosswords over Whatsapp when we get the chance. The exemplars are tough but they need highlighting—very well done!</li>
      <li><b>Tapan / Taps / Tapi:</b> Nice crossword. A bit tough. Got Help from Roopesh Mathur (1994 Batch, BTech, IIT Madras, Saras) for some of the clues.</li>
      <li><b>Isorropia:</b> Ukulele and Ukelele—this crossword is accepting the second spelling. Hidden exemplar—difficult to understand your question.</li>
      <li><b>Saki:</b> Nice and easy puzzle with a lot of thematic answers.</li>
      <li><b>Samit Kallianpur:</b> Nice grid.</li>
      <li><b>Shashwat S:</b> Very enjoyable grid with beginner-friendly cluing devices that pays tribute to a lot of unsung heroes in STEM.</li>
      <li><b>Supriya Mithal:</b> Excellent clues and surfaces and an enjoyable grid and theme. Look forward to more grids from you Gussalufz. Some favourites: 16A, 21A, 23A, 31A, 15D, 22D, 27D.</li>
      <li><b>Ganesh Nayak:</b> Very pleasant solve, ninas are great! BR Ambedkar took me by surprise as a "champion of balance" then figured why not, if a bit oblique. Would've been extra special if a word pertaining to Janaki Ammal was clued (Anna Mani got "ozone")—or perhaps I missed it. Loved that 1A set the tone for the puzzle, making it immaculate!</li>
      <li><b>BombayyaNYker:</b> Awesome GRID again. Always something to learn in Gussalufz GRIDS.</li>
      <li><b>Ashit Hegde:</b> The quality of the grid always suffer when the setter is constrained by the demands of having to include the additional puzzle. Good fun however if one is not a purist.</li>
      <li><b>Mona Sogal:</b> Wonderful grid... all the clues could be annotated perfectly... always enjoy your grids Gussalufz.</li>
      <li><b>JASR:</b> Loved it! Nice incorporation of the theme and ninas, along with the pangram. And yes, this was easier than your usual fare in THC, but fun nevertheless. 27D would be my top pick.</li>
      <li><b>Sowmya:</b> Good puzzle and theme.</li>
      <li><b>Veera Raghavan:</b> Well constructed crossword with clues ingeniously crafted.</li>
      <li><b>Nick Loader:</b> Wonderful wordplay, somehow = redundant. Surfaces: sameness = unnatural, Warsaw as G. I. Jozef, swap hands = unnatural, played with—surface works as 'electronic device' not 'musical instrument', if the latter 'electronic Spanish...', brew = unnatural, spurn = unnatural, rum up = unnatural, cricket surface bit vague. Other clues incredible 4 n 15a=#1 but more variety n difficulty pls. Gr8 bonus Qs.</li>
      <li><b>P K Dwarakanath:</b> Very good concept and should become a regular feature... Maybe prizes also? Wishing IITM a Happy and Successful New Year 2022 scaling new heights of excellence... </li>
      <li><b>Dr. S Venkatesh:</b> Well conceived. We need more such motivational puzzles which carry spirited message.</li>
      <li><b>Lakshmi Prakash:</b> Wonderful grid with a very powerful theme.</li>
