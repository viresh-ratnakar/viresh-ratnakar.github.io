  exolve-explanations:
    The "teacher" referred to by the title is Yoda. In the Star Wars movie, <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, while Luke Skywalker is learning to use the Force, Master Yoda gives him this stern admonition:
<blockquote>
Do. Or do not. There is no try.
</blockquote>
Yoda's admonition can be seen as a nina in the filled grid. Each of the eight "cross words" in it can be seen crossing a gap between two adjoining Across entries.
<p>
The two symmetrically placed entries, 8D and 22D, form the words, "FORCE USAGE," which is indeed the subject of the admonition. In addition, the surface of 27A refers to Star Wars, while the surface of 21D can be seen as describing Luke's perspective on the matter.
