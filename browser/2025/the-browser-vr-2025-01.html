  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Explanation</b>
<p>
The "Leo" in the title refers to Leonardo Fibonacci. You can see a nina running across the middle row and continuing down the middle column, that says, FIBONACCI CELLS. The letters found in the "Fibonacci cells" identified by numbers in the famous Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... (each number is added to its predecessor to get the next one) spell the name of the eight-letter "pet," AARDVARK.
</p>
<p>
The word AARDVARK is also described early on in any dictionary ("meaningful reference"), as noted in the puzzle preamble.
