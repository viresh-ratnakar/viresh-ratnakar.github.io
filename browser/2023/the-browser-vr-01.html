    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This puzzle contains a small nod to the fact that
it marks my debut with The Browser: the names of six
prominent web browsers are featured as solution entries.
They are: OPERA (12a), FIREFOX (13a+15d), EDGE (21a),
SAFARI (3d), EXPLORER (6d), and CHROME (23d).
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
