  exolve-explanations:
    <p>
The word DARKNESS can be seen in this crossword, as a nina
going around its 3 × 3 center, or "heart." Indeed, <i>Heart
of Darkness</i> is the three-word title that the puzzle
title alludes to. Author CONRAD can be seen as a nina
running down the first column, and the title of Coppola's
movie adaptation, APOCALYPSE NOW, is formed by 8D and 28D,
running down the last column.
