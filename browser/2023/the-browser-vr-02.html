<i><a href="http://thebrowser.com/crossword">The
Browser Crossword</a>: Cryptic #131 was first published on July 9, 2023. Made available

  exolve-explanations:
    <p>
This is my second crossword for The Browser, and,
continuing a trend, this one's theme is
<i>web-browsing</i>. The following entries are thematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li>2D. SURFING.</li>
<li>10A. NETWORK.</li>
<li>16D. WEB.</li>
<li>23D. COOKIES.</li>
<li>28A. HISTORY.</li>
</ul>
<p>
At a stretch, these two entries can also be construed as
being thematic: 1A. (TASKS) and 12A. (FIND).
</p>
<p>
Finally, the title is "Pioneer," as the crossword hides the
name of the pioneer of the World Wide Web,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">TIM
BERNERS-LEE</a>, as a nina. The name can be seen in 1D.
(TIMBER) and then continuing horizontally in the sixth row
from the top.
</p>
