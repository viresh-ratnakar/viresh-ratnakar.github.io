    <p>
    So, what do we have here? (8,8)

  exolve-question: What do we have here? (8,8) BIRTHDAY SOUVENIR

  exolve-explanations:
    <p>
    The central theme is 5 (formed by the black squares at the center of the
    grid), and "multiple squares/clues" refers to squares/clues that are
    numbered in multiples of 5 (the title alludes to this "times" interpretation
    of "multiple").
    </p>
    <p>
    The nina in the grid is BIRTHDAY, located at squares numbered 5, 10, 15,
    20, 25, 30, 35, 40, in order. The second 8-letter word is SOUVENIR, formed
    by the first letters ("for starters") of clues numbered 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
    30, 35, 40, in order.
