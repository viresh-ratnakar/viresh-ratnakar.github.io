    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
    This puzzle was my (winning!) submission in a crossword-setting competition
    ("Gridfest") in the 1ACross group, in 2017.
    </li>
    <li>
    “22⅘ Across” locates a Nina (it starts on the 8th white cell out of the 10
    that are between 22 and 23): GRIDFEST.
    </li>
    <li>
    Ragitvach is a (very) contrived Marathi version of Gussalufz, which is my
    usual pseudonym.
    </li>
    </ul>
