    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
There is a simple extra layer to be unravelled in this
puzzle: four clues use the word "one" that needs to be
replaced by the word "Reverend" (which is the solution
to 1 Across, the only "one" clue in the grid). These four
clues are all Spoonerism clues.
</p>
<p>
To keep the extra layer of trickery simple, the word "one"
is not used anywhere else in the puzzle, and all four clues
are the only ones to end in a question mark.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram. It was one of the crosswords used
in the online segment of the Indian Crossword League (IXL)
competition in 2021.
