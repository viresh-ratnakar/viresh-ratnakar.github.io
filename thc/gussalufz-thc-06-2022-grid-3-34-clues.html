  exolve-explanations:
    <p><b>Notes</b></p>

<p>
The theme of this crossword is the 1975 Hindi movie, SHOLAY,
seen as a nina running down the middle column. The movie's
iconic villain, GABBAR, is a nina in the middle row.
</p>

<p>
The following solution words are thematic, alluding to
various elements of <i>Sholay</i>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>5A. BULLETS.</li>
<li>10A. WIDOW.</li>
<li>23D. JAIL.</li>
<li>26D. HOOFS.</li>
<li>28A. TONGA.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With some latitude, a few more solution words can be called
thematic:
</p>

<ul>
<li>5D. BATTLE.</li>
<li>13D. TRAP.</li>
<li>25D. SLAUGHTERS.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The surface of 12A uses the thematic word, "Thakur."
</p>

<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>

<b>Prime time!</b>
<p>
I was quite pleased to see the THC serial number that this crossword landed on:
<b>13591</b>. It is a prime number. While that is nice in itself, prime
numbers are not that rare around this number (roughly every tenth number
is prime in this neighbourhood). But this is a <i>reversible</i> prime—its
reverse, <b>19531</b> is also prime! Further, of the five possible 4-digit
numbers that you get by deleting one digit from 19531, <i>three are prime!</i>
And one of those three happens to be <i>my house number</i> in my street
address!!
</p>

<p>
<b>Personal notes:</b>
I finished setting this crossword at a time of another
surgery in the family (this time it was my dog, Oona—all is
well now, thankfully). Joe Root shepherded an incredible
test match victory for England against New Zealand, and I
must say that watching good test cricket even when India
isn't involved is usually more fun for me these days than
watching limited overs cricket even when India is playing!
