  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
There are two ninas, HADDOCK and WOWBAGGER, located in the first and the last row.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Haddock">Captain Haddock</a> and <a href="http://hhgproject.org/entries/wowbagger.html">Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged</a> are both fictional characters who are famous for their creative insults and curses.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the following solutions and surfaces are connected to the theme of insulting:
</p>
<ul>
<li> 1d. HASSLE.</li>
<li> 3d. DEFAMATION.</li>
<li> 6d. CUSS.</li>
<li> 7d. The surface reads like a Captain Haddock statement.</li>
<li> 12a. NOSEBAG may be hurled as a creative insult by the likes of Haddock and Wowbagger.</li>
<li> 14a. Similarly, SHODDIEST may be unleashed as a colourful adjective in an insult.</li>
<li> 23d. TEASER.</li>
<li> 27a. TROLL.</li>
<li> 28a. DENIGRATE.</li>
</ul>
