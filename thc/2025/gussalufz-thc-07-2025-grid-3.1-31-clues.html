  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The nina running across the fourth row from the top and the fourth row from the bottom spells out HORROR MOVIES, and that's the theme of this crossword.
The title refers to <i>Us,</i> a famous horror movie.
</p>
<p>
A few other horror movies can be found in solution words:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1a. <i>Watchdog.</i> It's an obscure horror movie, not one that was intentionally included by me!</li>
<li>5d and 25d. <i>Get Out.</i></li>
<li>6a. <i>Shaman.</i></li>
<li>11a. <i>Misery.</i></li>
<li>12d. <i>[The] Shining.</i></li>
<li>22a. <i>Scream.</i></li>
<li>26a. <i>Prey.</i></li>
<li>27a. <i>Psycho.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
A couple of other loosely thematic connections: an AJAR (15d) door can often lead to horrors; VILLAINOUS (24a) characters need to be thoroughly destroyed lest they strike back. <i>Cottontail</i> (10a) happens to be a movie too (Japanese), but it's not a horror movie.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle landed on a palindromic number, 14,541!
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I sprained my back while moving a suitcase somewhat lazily. Sitting in a car the next day for multiple hours (family road trip to Los Angeles) exacerbated things to such an extent that I found myself completely unable to walk. So, I have learned now that at my age, I should put serious thought into posture and positioning before moving anything hefty. And that if I do sprain my back ever again, I should not go on a long road trip the next day.
</p>

<p>
The back is almost fully back in shape now, thankfully.
