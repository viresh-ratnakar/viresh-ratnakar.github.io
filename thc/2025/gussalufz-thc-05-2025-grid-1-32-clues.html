  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The title, in Hindi, means "whole black gram" (a popular lentil). <i>Khadi</i> also means "upright" in Hindi, so the cryptic interpretation of the title is URAD &lt;&lt;, or DARU, which means liquor in Hindi. The entry WHISKY (11a) spells out the theme more specifically.
</p>
<p>
A couple of fine Indian whiskies can be seen as ninas in the grid: RAMPUR across the middle row, and AMRUT down the middle column. A third Indian whisky, PAUL JOHN, is formed by 14a and 19a.
</p>
<p>
SODA (4d) and NEAT (25d) are symmetrically located thematic entries.
</p>

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
War rages on in Ukraine, war looms in India (hope what's already transpired is the end of it), and my adopted country indulges in more buffoonery as well as comic-book villainy. If only humanity had begun evolution south of the Nile, where resources were plentiful, then, perhaps, like the bonobos, we'd have been altogether less inclined to tribal slaughter.
</p>

<p>
My son Kavi has made his call and will be joining the aviation program at San Jose State University this autumn. Am excited and happy for his next chapter.
