    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The 1985 hit sci-fi movie, <i>Back to the Future</i>, is the theme of this crossword. The name of the movie can be seen as a nina formed by 4d (BACK) and 21d (FUTURE), connected by cells going diagonally downwards and reading TO THE, starting at the head of 12a.
</p>
<p>
The title of the crossword can be read cryptically as <i>The Power of Love</i>, which is the movie's theme song, by the band, Huey Lewis and the News.
</p>
<p>
"DeLorean" (the car used as a time machine in the movie) can be seen as a nina, running down the second column. A key location in the movie is the Clock Tower, which can be seen in symmetrically placed entries 23d and 7d. The entry in 19a can be seen as TIME running backwards.
</p>
<p>
This is my first THC crossword drafted in 2025. This one is <i>not</i> a "salgram" (it uses 23 distinct letters, not 25). While I might do a few salgrams later this year, I'm moving away from the gag of making every single one a salgram, unlike last year.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I finished setting this one in the middle of happy vacationing times with family. Am heading to India soon, but will be back by the time this is published.

I had tickets to see Zakir Hussain in concert in March 2025. What a terrible loss for all of us! I've been listening to his incredible music over and over. Here's <a href="https://youtu.be/cPNU9jxkiY4">a link to a lovely concert</a> featuring Zakir, Dave Holland, Shankar Mahadevan, Louis Banks, and others.
