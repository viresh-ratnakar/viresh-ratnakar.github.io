    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword is themed around the Academy Awards for movies (in which Oscar statuettes are awarded to the winners, hence the title). OSCAR can be seen as a nina running down the last column, straddling 8d and 15d.
</p>
<p>
The titles of these best-picture-winning movies can be found in the puzzle:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1d. MOONLIGHT (2016).</li>
<li>18d. PLATOON (1986).</li>
<li>24d. CODA (2021).</li>
<li>28a. ROCKY (1976).</li>
<li>PARASITE (2019): a circular nina in the middle.</li>
<li>ANORA (2024): nina in the 9th column, straddling 5d and 14d.</li>
</ul>
<p>
RED CARPET in 4d is also thematic.
PIANO in 5d is slightly thematic: <i>The Piano</i> (1993) was nominated but did not win.
GENE in 12a can be construed to be thematic, as Gene Hackman won quite a
few Oscars.
</p>
<p>
I'm using a new grid design in this crossword, replacing a grid design that did not have good connectivity across the left and right halves. This grid has 30 lights, which is nice as my other three THC grid designs have 29, 31, and 32 lights. It also has two 14-letter lights, which I do not have in any of the other designs, opening up new opportunities.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I was doing the grid fill while the Oscar awards ceremony was going on (March 2, 2025). After <i>Anora</i> won the best picture award, I tweaked the grid a bit to get it in too as a nina, above the RA that I already had available in a suitable spot (having already hidden PARASITE in the middle).
</p>
<p>
This is the third year for my cherry tree, and it just blossomed. Hope we get at least a few dozen cherries this year. The state of affairs in the U.S. continues to be grim, and any joy on offer—from cherries and nesting finches and crosswords and running and beer—needs to be maximally embraced.
