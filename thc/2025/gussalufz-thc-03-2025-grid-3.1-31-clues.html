  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The theme of this puzzle is the Bridge card game. The full name of the game is "Contract Bridge," and the title ("20 + 27") spells out this name using the solutions to 20a and 27a.
</p>
<p>
Down the 13th column, you can see a nina that says "NO TRUMPS," which is a bid in Bridge, in which no suit is designated as the trump. Additionally, the following entries are thematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li>3d. TRICK.</li>
<li>5d. BID.</li>
<li>6d. AUCTION.</li>
<li>25d. ACE.</li>
</ul>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
Another spring approaches, and the finches are at it again, building their nest on a shaded ledge alongside my house. Hope it works out for them (may the nest-raiding blue jays stay away!). It's adorable to watch them diligently gather little broken twigs from bushes, fly up to the nest, put on their architect's thinking cap, and finally place each twig perfectly.
</p>
<p>
A while back, I added support for "<a href="https://viresh-ratnakar.github.io/test-farrell-quantum.html">quantum puzzles</a>" to Exolve. This particular puzzle is of a quantum nature in a different way. The nina and the title (47!) can be seen in a different light, as can be these entries: 1a, 9a, 10a, 4d, 8d, 16d, and 23d. This alternative theme extends to the surface of 14d (7d too?). For anyone in the U.S. or even around the world, this other theme is an inescapable presence these days.
