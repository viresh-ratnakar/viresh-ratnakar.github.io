  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword's theme is the poem "<a href="https://allpoetry.com/funeral-blues">Funeral Blues</a>" by W. H. Auden. The title of the crossword suggests anagramming "Baleful Nurse," which yields the title of the poem.
</p>
<p>
Some key elements from the poem can be found in the grid entries. DISMANTLE SUN can be seen in 9d and part of 10d. PACK UP MOON is formed by 21d and 25d. STOP CLOCKS is seen in part of 14a and 23d.
</p>
<p>
The poet's last name is visible as a nina in the fifth row.
</p>
<p>
Death, departure, fear of death, and closure are also alluded to by the following entries: 11a (STUMPED), 13a (PANIC), 14a (STOPPAGES), 27a (LET GO), 5d (LEAVE OFF), and 7d (ENDING).
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I lost a very dear friend recently. Jayesh Rewatkar was my classmate in school. He was a live-life-kingsize frood who was best buddy to hundreds of folks. I'm still in shock, and couldn't help but pick a mournful theme for this crossword.
</p>
<p>
A PSA: please make arrangements to share your online accounts (user names, passwords, pins) for emails, banks, investments, retirement accounts, etc. with your family. You just never know!
