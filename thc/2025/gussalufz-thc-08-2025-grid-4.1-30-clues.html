    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The theme of this crossword is that common-but-amazing mathematical construct, the <i>equation.</i> The title alludes to this two-sided equality, and you can see EQUATION as a nina running down the fourth column. The following entries are thematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1a. POLES. These are points where reciprocals of complex functions can be equated to zero.</li>
<li>5d. SOLVE. We like to solve equations to identify what values of variables make the two sides equal.</li>
<li>8d. TERM. That's the, er, term for a component of an equation.</li>
<li>14d. VARIABLES. They are the unknown quantities in equations.</li>
<li>19a. ZERO. It is the term used for a solution to an equation of the form <i>f(x) = 0</i>.</li>
<li>24d. ROOT. That's another term for a solution or zero of an equation of the form <i>f(x) = 0</i>.</li>
<li>28a. CURVE. A curve on a graph is what might be defined using an equation with variables.</li>
</ul>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
The back is still not a 100% back (I think every time I forget to bend my knees it just regresses a bit). I've now bought a thing that used to be a fixture in every desi home: a hot water bag. It seems to be helping (along with stretching exercises). I did manage to get through the San Francisco Half Marathon (HM #27 for me) as the back issues generally haven't affected my running.
</p>
<p>
The son has forbidden social-media-bragging, so I'll just brag here in this space largely invisible to him: on August 4, 2025, Kavi flew his first solo flight!
