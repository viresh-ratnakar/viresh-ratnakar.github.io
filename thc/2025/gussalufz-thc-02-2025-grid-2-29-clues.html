  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
There are a couple of connected ninas in this crossword. Along the top row and continuing along the fifth row from the bottom, you can see "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">DOCTOR WHO</a>" and "TARDIS" (the time travelling spaceship used in the show).
</p>

<p>
The long 15-letter entry in 16a, "FOR THE TIME BEING," can be construed to be a cryptic reference, with this crossword being "for" Dr. Who, who can be thought of as "the time being."
</p>

<p>
The title, "How To Get, <i>How?</i>" is a cryptic clue (reverse anagram) for "DOCTOR WHO."
</p>

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I gained around 8 lbs over my short 10-day India trip in January, through an abundance of indulgent binges, in spite of lots of running, swimming, and walking. It will probably now take me month to burn it off! But it was definitely worth it—Mumbai has some <i>really</i> fine restaurants. Some notable ones that I enjoyed: The Table, Souk, Avartana, Neuma, Ekaa, Bombay Brasserie.
I'm already thinking about next year's revisit!
