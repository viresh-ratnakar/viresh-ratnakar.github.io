    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword's theme is beer. There are three ninas that
are all varieties of beer. PILSNER can be seen in the sixth
row from the bottom. MARZEN can be seen running diagonally
downwards starting at the sixth cell from the right in the
top row. LAGER is the nina in the bottom right corner,
running diagonally upwards, starting in the second-last
row and the fifth-from-last column.
</p>
<p>
Two solution entries (and their clues) are
patently alcohol/beer-related: BOOZE (7d), and NEAR BEER
(12a).
</p>
<p>
Three more solution entries are varieties of beer or
beer-related words that have non-beer-related meanings too
(and those meanings have been used in their clues as
definitions). They are: PORTER (11a), HOPS (14a), STOUT
(23d).
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I finished setting this crossword right after cooking some
<i>gaakars</i>. My late mother, Vasudha Ratnakar (nee Tara
Dashputre), used to make <i>incredibly</i> delicious gaakars
that were spoken of in hushed reverential tones by all
manner of relatives and friends. What on earth is a gaakar?
Well, this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m39Umw1Ed1Y">recipe
video</a> comes close to getting it right. But you've got
to add ajwain seeds and a bit of rava!
