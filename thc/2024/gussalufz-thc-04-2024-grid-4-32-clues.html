    <b>Notes</b>

<p>
The theme of this crossword is <i>table tennis</i>. A secondary theme is lawn tennis, as there is much overlap between these sports (some thematic clues do relate to only one of the two).
</p>

<p>
PING-PONG can be seen as a nina running down the second-to-last column. The following entries are related to the theme:
</p>

<ul>
<li>1A. FOREHAND.</li>
<li>10A. TOPSPIN.</li>
<li>11A. TABLE.</li>
<li>10D. TENNIS.</li>
<li>27A. SERVICE.</li>
<li>17D. PADDLE.</li>
<li>24D. POINT.</li>
</ul>

<p>
LINESMEN (12A.) were a part of lawn tennis till recently.
</p>

<p>
The title, "Let's Replay," is a play on the fact that 
a "let" call on a table tennis serve means the serve touched the net and is not counted—the server has been instructed by the umpire to serve again. In other words, "Let's (Let is) Replay."
</p>

<p>
Like my previous THC crosswords this year ('24), this one too uses exactly 24 letters in the solution words. 
</p>

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I do quite enjoy playing table tennis myself. Am not <i>that</i> good at it, but am not that bad either. I always carry the following items in my backpack: a ping-pong paddle and a ball or two, and a towel (the latter is a versatile and invaluable carry-on, as famously noted by Douglas Adams).
</p>

<p>
As we head into another summer, my adorably <i>badmash</i> dog Oona is now nine, and every little health issue she now experiences is a sharp reminder that these incredible creatures have an unfairly short lifespan. Every day with them is worth cherishing!
