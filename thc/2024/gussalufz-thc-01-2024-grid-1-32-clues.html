  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The theme of this crossword is the city of 
<i>Mumbai</i>. Its oldest known name is the title,
<i>Kakamuchee</i> 
(another, possibly slightly later name was 
<i>Galajunkja</i>). The more modern old name of the
city, <i>BOMBAY</i>, is seen as a nina running down the
middle column.
</p>

<p>
Two famous localities of the city can be seen as 
additional ninas: <i>CHAUPATI</i> (running down the 
fourth column) and <i>JUHU</i> (diagonally climbing
in the bottom-right corner).
</p>

<p>
A few entries can be seen as thematic: GATEWAY (10A, 
for <i>Gateway of India</i>), APOLLO (24A, for <i>Apollo
Bunder</i>), and ISLAND (11A). INSHORE (9A) can 
possibly be construed to be slightly thematic.
</p>

<p>
The entries in this crossword use 24 distinct letters,
as an esoteric nod to the new year that we now find 
ourselves in.
</p>

<p>
The surface of 1A might seems a bit odd, but it pretty
closely describes <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/when-rahul-tore-ordinance-on-disqualification-1202985.html">a
seminal political event in India</a>.
</p>

<b>Personal notes</b>

<p>
I came to Bombay in 1986 and spent four delightful years
there. It continues to be the city most dear to me—a 
bond that I now celebrate every year with a visit and
through running the half marathon there. Am looking 
forward to this year's visit, about to happen in just a 
few more days!
