  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The title ("Silky pad?") can be seen as reverse wordplay for KIDS PLAYGROUND, which is the theme of this crossword.
</p>
<p>
KIDS is the solution to 26a, and PLAYGROUND can be seen as a nina running across the 6th rows from the top and bottom. In addition, the following entries are thematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li>6a., 9a. MONKEY BARS.</li>
<li>10a. EXERCISING.</li>
<li>27a. SWINGS.</li>
<li>5d., 25d. SEE-SAW.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, COURTYARD (13a.) and ROADSIDE (16d.) too often are places where kids play.
</p>
<p>
For those who've been tracking, it won't be a surprise that this puzzle too is a salgram: it's another '24 puzzle that uses exactly 24 letters in its entries.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
The remodelling work at my house finished last month. The company that handled the design and execution is a local business in my small town. It has in fact put up "before" and "after" pictures of parts of my house in its storefront window, and I see them every time I walk along downtown's Main Street!
</p>
<p>
I'm wrapping up this crossword just after the U.S. elections. While I am disappointed by the results, at least this time it's not a shock, like it was in 2016.
