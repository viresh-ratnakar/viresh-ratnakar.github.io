    <b>Notes</b>

<p>
The theme of this crossword is the David Bowie song, <i>Changes</i>. The title (written misleadingly to look like a chemistry formula) alludes to the "Ch-Ch-Changes" refrain from the song. The word CHANGES is the solution to 9a. DAVID can be seen as a nina starting at the end of 13a and continuing into 14a. BOWIE can be seen as a nina running down the tenth column.
</p>

<p>
The following solution words are thematic too, as they can be seen in the <a href="https://genius.com/David-bowie-changes-lyrics">song's lyrics</a>: TURN (8d) and FACE (26d) the STRANGE (28a).
</p>

<p>
The theme also commemorates the passing of '24 (24d is ADIEU) and arrival of '25 (25a is HELLO).
</p>

<p>
The following entries can also be construed to be thematic: OLDER (11a), PERIOD (13a), and SEASON (22d).
</p>

<p>
This, my final THC crossword drafted in '24, is also a salgram: it uses exactly 24 letters in the grid. It managed to spill over and was published on the first day of 2025.
</p>

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
Looks like some of the lifestyle tweaks that I made (plus statins!) have had good impact. I feel fitter, and my health metrics are all back in good shape.
</p>
<p>
I'm looking forward to late December and all of January. First, my daughter will be home for her holidays, bringing the whole family together. Then, once again I will be in India, literally running around and living the good life.
