    <b>Notes</b>

<p>
<i>Things that can fly</i> would be a good response to the question posed in the title, and that's the theme of this crossword.
</p>

<p>
ZEPPELIN can be seen as a nina running down the first column. The entries in 5D, 25D, and 12D (running down the middle column, with just a slight change in order) from HOT AIR BALLOON. AIRPLANE is another thematic nina, running down the 13<sup>th</sup> column.
</p>

<p>
The following three entries are thematic too, being things that can fly: 6A (SERAPH), 8D (PILOT), and 26A (GNAT). The surface of 20A is slightly thematic too.
</p>

<p>
Continuing on from the last couple of months, this third THC crossword of mine for 2024 also uses exactly 24 letters in the grid.
</p>

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I'm really happy right now as my daughter has just been accepted into a PhD program in neuroscience that she has been very keen on (Boston University). My own PhD years were immensely satisfying, and I think times spent pursuing your passions are absolutely the best times.
