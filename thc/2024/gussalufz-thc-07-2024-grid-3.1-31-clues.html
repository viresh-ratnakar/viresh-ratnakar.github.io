    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The title of the crossword (<i>Tom-tomming Typhoons!</i>) sounds like something Captain Haddock might exclaim. However, the theme here is not <i>Tintin</i>-related: both <i>tom-tom</i> and <i>typhoon</i> are words that have been taken from Indian languages into English, and this linguistic borrowing (<i>looting?</i>) is the theme of this crossword. The following entries are all words that fit the theme:
</p>
<ul>
<li> 5d. COT.</li>
<li> 6a. TEAPOY.</li>
<li> 6d. TEHSILS.</li>
<li> 9a. ALOO.</li>
<li> 12d. BANDANA.</li>
<li> 15a. THUG.</li>
<li> 17a. CHIT.</li>
<li> 23d. ROTIS.</li>
<li> 25d. LAC.</li>
<li> 26a. TANK.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The title of a famous book that catalogues such words, <i><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Hobson_Jobson/PQYYAAAAMAAJ?gbpv=1">HOBSON-JOBSON</a></i>, can be seen as a nina running across the fourth and twelfth rows. The story behind and controversy over the book's title are interesting and can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson-Jobson" "="">its Wikipedia page</a>.
</p>
<p>
To go with the theme, the usage, <i>"..., no?"</i> in 22a. is distinctly Indian-flavoured.
</p>
<p>
This, my seventh THC crossword in '24, is also a <i>salgram</i>, as its solution words use only 24 letters. I coined the word "salgram" in the notes in my last THC, and I'll try to keep using it to make it stick :-).
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I'm not a "car person," and I'm certainly not a "car race person" (I've happily ranked last on the rare occasions that I've gone Go Karting). But my son <i>is</i> a car person and a racing car person (he is also learning to be a pilot). And so it was that my family's just-concluded summer trip to Vienna included a day at the Spielberg Red Bull Ring, watching the finale of the 2024 Austrian F1 Grand Prix. I will admit, it was more fun that I expected, with the music and the crowd and the air show and what-not, and as it turned out to be a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/30/lando-norris-hits-out-at-reckless-max-verstappen-after-f1-austrian-gp">dramatic race</a>.
</p>
<p>
A couple of days after we reached back, I caught my first COVID infection. I feel much better already on the second day, as I write this; hopefully it will be a short encounter.
