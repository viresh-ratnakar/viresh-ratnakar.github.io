  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
Apart from <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> series of novels, Douglas Adams also wrote two novels featuring the private detective, Dirk Gently. These form the theme of this puzzle.
</p>

<p>
The title of the puzzle refers to the title of the second novel in the series, <i>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul.</i> The words LONG and DARK are the solutions to 25d and 6d, respectively. TEA-TIME can be seen as a nina running across the fifth row from the bottom. The phrase "of the soul" can be found in the surface of 19a.
</p>

<p>
DIRK is a nina spanning the end of 11a and the beginning 12a, and GENTLY is the solution to 1d. In addition, the following entries are thematic:
</p>

<ul>
<li>3d. EVERYTHING. This one is only loosely thematic. It is in the Hitchhiker's series novel, <i>Life, the Universe and Everything,</i> that Adams first used the phrase, "the long dark teatime of the soul."</li>
<li>5d. HOLISTIC. The first novel is titled <i>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.</i></li>
<li>14a. DETECTIVE.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This puzzle is also a salgram (I can't stop now, can I!?): it's another '24 puzzle that uses exactly 24 letters in its entries.
</p>

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
Over the period that I set this puzzle:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Remodelling work at my house wrapped up.</li>
<li>My talented daughter got another sci-fi story published in <i>Clarkesworld</i> magazine (here's a <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/author/arula-ratnakar/">link to all of them</a>).</li>
<li>A doctor's visit and some tests made it imperative that I improve my eating and exercise habits <i>even</i> more. Nothing serious, just the usual afflictions of a South-Asian-origin male.</li>
</ul>
