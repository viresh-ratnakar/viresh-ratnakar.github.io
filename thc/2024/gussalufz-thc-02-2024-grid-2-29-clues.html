    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword hides a nina that says "PRIME NUMBERS,"
down the middle column and continuing across the fifth
row from the bottom.
</p>
<p>
The following entries are connected to the theme of
prime numbers: FACTORS (11a), PRODUCT (12a),
MULTIPLICATIONS (16a), and MODULO (7d).
</p>
<p>
The title alludes to the fact that the number <i>one</i> is
not included in the definition of prime numbers even
though it <i>seems</i> to meet the criteria. Here's
a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/why-isnt-1-a-prime-number/">good reference</a>
for the reasons.
</p>
<p>
This is my second THC in 2024, and just like the first
one, it uses exactly 24 letters in the grid.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I composed this one mostly in India during my visit
there in January (mostly on flights to/from India, to
be precise). During this trip, apart from running the
Mumbai half marathon, I also ran nostalgically through 
the streets of the city where I was born and lived 
through my school years: Bhopal. They are also starting
a yearly marathon there now. Perhaps I'll run that some day.
