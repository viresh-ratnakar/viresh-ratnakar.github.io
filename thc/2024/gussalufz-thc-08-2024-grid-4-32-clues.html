  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This puzzle's theme is <i>Tintin in Tibet,</i> the 20th volume of <i>The Adventures of Tintin</i> comics series. TINTIN IN TIBET can be seen as a nina running across the second and tenth rows.
</p>
<p>
On page 11 in the book, Captain Haddock bumps into a porter in Kathmandu and lets out his trademark stream of invective. Of course, the accident was entirely Haddock's fault, and the porter responds in kind, shouting in Hindi, "Kyon ji? Dekhte nahi, samne kya hai?" ("Hey, you? Can't you see what's in front of you?). The words KYON JI can be seen as a nina running across the sixth row). There is a reference to Hindi in 8d.
</p>
<p>
A bit later, on page 14, Haddock bumps into the same porter again, and it is again Haddock's fault. The porter snaps, "Kya? Phir Vahi? ("What? You again?"), which is the title of this crossword.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the following entries are thematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li> 10a. CAPTAIN.</li>
<li> 26d. YETI.</li>
<li> 30a. REPORTER.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Like my other THC crosswords in '24, this one uses exactly 24 letters in its entries (i.e., this one too is a <i>salgram</i>).
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
When I first read <i>Tintin in Tibet</i> as a ten-ish-years old boy, I remember the utter joy I felt when I encountered the porter's appearance and saw the words in Hindi! I hope many across India have gone through the same goosebumps experience over the years (perhaps you did too!).
</p>
<p>
I used to get my Tintins and Asterixes from a kids' library named <i>Manjari</i> in Bhopal. That library felt like a treasure island to me, full of all kinds of "foreign" books that I methodically devoured (Casper, Richie Rich, Lucky Luke, Enid Blyton, The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Biggles, ...).
</p>
<p>
The library was well connected to the arts scene in Bhopal, and when I was around 13, I spent a summer as an actor in two kids' plays organized by the library, directed by two famous theatre personalities: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansi_Kaul">Bansi Kaul</a> (who was honoured with a Padma Shri award posthumously) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._V._Karanth">B. V. Karanth</a> (also a Padma Shri recipient, but turned out to have a horrible dark side). The plays were staged at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Bhavan">Bharat Bhavan</a>, a stunning lakeside arts center designed by architect Charles Correa.
