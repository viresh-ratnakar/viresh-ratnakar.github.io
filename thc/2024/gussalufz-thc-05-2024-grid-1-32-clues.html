    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword is themed around special days commemorated in the month of May.
</p>
<ul>
<li> 1A. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day">TOWEL</a> Day is on May 25.</li>
<li> 6D. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day">MEMORIAL</a> Day in the U.S. is on the last Monday of May.
</li><li> 8D. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Day_(United_States)">MOTHER'S</a> Day is on the second Sunday of May.</li>
<li> 23D. BIRTH is relevant to the theme as there are two famous May birthdays captured as ninas in the grid: BUDDHA in the fourth column and TAGORE in the second-to-last column.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The theme, "MAY DAYS," is cryptically identified by the title of the crossword (<i>21s?</i>), as the solution to 21D. is MAYDAY.
</p>
<p>
I try to set an easy (easier?) THC crossword every now and then, and this is one of those. There are lots of anagrams, hidden answers, and alternations. Like all my other 2024 THC puzzles so far, this one also uses exactly 24 letters in the solution words.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
There's been some remodelling going on at my house, expected to last till late summer. As I write this, the freshly re-tiled kitchen is inaccessible to us for some time (of course, my curious dog Oona managed to sneak in for an inspection!). Several items of furniture have been temporarily crammed into various rooms.
</p>
<p>
All of this reminds me of similar scenes from my childhood, when we lived in state-government-owned quarters in Bhopal, and there would be periodic whitewashing (<i>choona putai</i>) and distempering, that would require large-scale furniture rearrangements. I can still remember the utter delight that I felt as a child during such times, as these temporary piles of furniture and storage items created fantastic play areas for exploration and pretend-play!
