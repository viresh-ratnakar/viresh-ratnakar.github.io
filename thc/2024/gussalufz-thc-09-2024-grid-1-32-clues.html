  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The theme of this crossword is the beginning of our universe. The title, <i>Zero Hours</i>, refers to the absolute beginning of time itself, when 0 hours have elapsed. UNIVERSE can be seen as a nina down the second column, and BIG BANG can be seen as a nina running down the tenth column.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the following entries are thematic: TELESCOPE (28A), BIRTH (29A), STEADY STATE (3D and 7D), and TIME (25D).
</p>

<p>
This puzzle is a <i>salgram</i> again (i.e., it's a '24 puzzle that uses 24 letters in its entries).
</p>

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I travelled a bit more this last month: Boston (ran again around the Charles), and New York (ran along the shore of the Hudson, visited the 9/11 memorial).
</p>

<p>
I've recently got around to finally doing a vanity project that I've wanted to do for a while: I've published my first fifty THC crosswords in book form, under the title, <i>Goddess &amp; Murphy</i> (see <a href="https://gussalufz.com#goddess-and-murphy">my site</a> for details). Readers of my personal notes might have previously spotted the origins of the title.
</p>

<p>
At the very least, this project made me add a host of printing improvements and features to <a href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve">Exolve</a> (which I used for formatting the book's crossword pages).
