  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The title, <i>Semordnilap,</i> is a word that was probably coined by the self-proclaimed "Father of Logology," <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Borgmann">Dmitri Borgmann</a>. A semordnilap is a term that forms another meaningful term when reversed. There are eight semordnilaps scattered through the grid:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1D. REPAID reverses to DIAPER. The solution to 16A. (BACK TO SQUARE ONE) can be (at a stretch!) construed to be alluding to this semordnilap.</li>
<li>6D. SPOT reverses to TOPS.</li>
<li>10A. PACER reverses to RECAP.</li>
<li>23D. REWARD reverses to DRAWER.</li>
<li>25D. BARD reverses to DRAB.</li>
<li>27D. LEVER reverses to REVEL.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The other two semordnilaps are hidden as ninas. SPOOL (reverses to LOOPS) and SMART (reverses to TRAMS) can be seen running down the sixth and tenth columns, respectively.
</p>
<p>
This, my sixth THC crossword in '24, also uses 24 distinct letters in the solution entries. Inspired by Borgmann, I hereby coin a word for this kind of a puzzle: a <i>salgram</i>, with "sal" read like "säl," the Hindi word for "year" :-).
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
Last year was the first bloom for our new cherry tree, and while it only produced a handful of cherries, they were utterly delicious. Unfortunately, while the tree has grown substantially, the fruit yield seems even smaller this year. Either the local bird and squirrel population has pulled off a successful heist, or it's just a normal variation, or something else.
