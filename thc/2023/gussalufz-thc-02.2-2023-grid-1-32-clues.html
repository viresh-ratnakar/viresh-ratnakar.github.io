    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword's theme is an old board game from India,
<i>Snakes and Ladders</i>. SNAKES can be seen as a nina
snaking down diagonally towards the left, starting just
under the cell numbered 10. LADDERS can be seen climbing
up diagonally towards the right, starting at the cell
numbered 25.
</p>
<p>
The following entries are also connected to the theme:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1a: BOARD.</li>
<li>11a: SQUARE.</li>
<li>14a: DICE.</li>
<li>19a. DRAW.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
This one was composed close on the heels of my last THC
crossword. The only noteworthy event in this short
interlude has been that I have acquired and played with
a Rubik's cube variant called the
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_blocks">mirror
cube</a>," which does not have different colours on its
sides, but instead has three layers with different
thicknesses. When scrambled, it's no longer a cube.
</p>
<p>
I struggled with it for a while, until I realized that
the pieces belonging to the thinnest layer were easy to
identify, and hence using that as the first layer is a
good idea. My muscle memories of solution steps also
failed to carry over from the normal cube to this
weirdly shaped thing, so I had to write down some of
the steps first.
