  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The title is the name of an old Hindi film; it means
"two detectives" in Hindi.
</p>
<p>
The famous mystery writer, AGATHA CHRISTIE, can be
seen as a nina running down the middle and fourteenth
columns. Two famous fictional detectives created by
her can also be seen as ninas: POIROT running across
the middle row, and MARPLE in the third column, spanning
the end of 2D and the start of 19D.
</p>
<p>
The surface of 25A is also thematic.
</p>
<p>
SKIMMIA (28A) is not a common word, and the clue is 
quite difficult too. I generally like to set simple 
clues for uncommon words. However, in this case, once I 
came up with the rough idea for the surface, I couldn't 
resist using it, given George W. Bush's famously
premature <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Accomplished_speech">"Mission Accomplished" speech</a> from 2003.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram. Its THC serial number, 14,057, is
a prime number. This has happened after a longish gap, thereby adjusting
the fraction of my THC crosswords that have landed on prime numbers
to a more reasonable value in line with the expectation of around 1 in 10
(<i>log<sub>e</sub>14000</i>).
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I read quite a few Agatha Christie novels in my early teens. I discovered Kenneth Branagh's spectacularly
good-looking Poirot movies, <i>Death On The Nile</i>
and <i>Murder On The Orient Express</i>, only recently, and they may have subconsciously made me pick this 
crossword's theme. I'm looking forward to watching his
latest, <i>A Haunting In Venice</i>.
