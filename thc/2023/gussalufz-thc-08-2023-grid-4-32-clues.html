    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This puzzle's theme is the epic set of mythical stories,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Aur_Betaal"><i>Vikram and Betaal</i></a>.
VIKRAM can be seen as a nina running across
the middle row, and BETAAL can be seen as a nina running
down the middle column.
</p>
<p>
The following entries are related to the theme:
</p>
<ul>
<li>5A. SPIRIT.</li>
<li>8D. TREE.</li>
<li>9A. SILENCE.</li>
<li>
25A. TALES. Doubly thematic, being located at
#25, as <i>Vikram and Betaal</i> has 25 tales
(the title, "25 25," can be decoded as "25 Tales").
</li>
<li>28A. LONG-AGO.</li>
<li>29A. CORPSE.</li>
<li>26D. EPIC.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Merlin,</i> referenced in 30A, was also a mythical
figure with magical powers, associated with a king.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>
<p>
While trying to get a pangram and trying to fit the theme,
a few obscure entries made their way into this
crossword. I've tried to set easy clues for these. Hope it
all works out!
</p>
<p>
Erratum: The published version of this crossword used
"civets" as rhe definition for LINSANGS, in 30A.
I had known nothing about linsangs until they appeared as
a grid-fill suggestion, and had googled to find the
definition. Solver Chris Lissman correctly pointed out
that the definition wasn't quite accurate. The version
seen here now corrects the flaw, using "tree-dwelling
carnivores" as the definition.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I'm wrapping this up in the first week of August 2023.
Summer travels took me to Paris (saw the Bastille Day 
fireworks, from so close to the Eiffel Tower that some 
ashes landed next to my champagne glass!) and Boston (ran 
around Charles river yet again). Already can't wait for the 
next trip (probably India in January 2024).
