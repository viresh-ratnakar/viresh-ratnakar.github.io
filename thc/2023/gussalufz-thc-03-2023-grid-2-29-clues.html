  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword celebrates the legendary musician,
guitarist sans compare, Carlos Santana. His last name
can be seen as a nina running down the second column.
<i>Inner Secrets</i> is the name of a Santana album,
and in the above preamble it also hints that there is
a theme to be found.
</p>
<p>
The following entries are connected to the theme:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
10a, 27a, 22a together form BLACK MAGIC WOMAN,
a famous Santana song.
</li>
<li>
4d: LEGEND.
</li>
<li>
25d: ROCK.
</li>
<li>
21d: GUITAR.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most of my recent THC puzzles have been pangrams. The
surface of 27a refers to a pangram. But, this particular
puzzle, for a change, is <i>not</i> a pangram.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
With ChatGPT and Bard making waves, AI is very much in
the news right now. I have been likening these
conversation bots to "drunk uncles"—loquacious and
opinionated creatures that do not make much sense when
examined rigorously. I expect they will learn to make
much more sense over time, but like with any other
uncle or aunt, a certain amount of wariness will always
be warranted on our part.
</p>
<p>
Will these bots be able to solve crosswords? Absolutely.
But I think the more interesting question is, will they
be able to <i>set</i> crosswords? I think it will be
harder for them to get there, but eventually, yes. But
AI already does a great job in <i>assisting</i> a human
setter (see the "Charades" and "Anagrams" tabs in my own
<a href="https://exet.app">Exet</a> software, for
example), and I think such assistive features are going
to get better at a rapid pace!
