  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
"Stripper" in the title refers to a creator of a cartoon
strip. The creator in question is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Ninan">AJIT
NINAN</a> (who unfortunately passed away recently), and you 
can see his name as a nina. The full nina—running down the 
first column, continuing down the eleventh column, and
finally going across the middle row—includes the name of a 
character that Ajit created: Detective MOOCHHWALA. The 
detective's partner, his dog POOCH, is the solution to 23D. 
The name of the children's magazine, TARGET, in which 
Moochhwala and Pooch appeared regularly, is formed by 5D 
and 25D.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
Growing up, I really looked forward to the mail delivery of 
<i>Target</i> magazine every month. I must have read every 
issue during the period 1980-1984. What stood out for me in 
the Moochhwala strips was the amazing level of detail
that made you linger over every single frame. I also
remember there being a lot of animals in the strip (in 
addition to Pooch!), always endearingly portrayed,
often helpful in catching the baddies. Towards the latter
part of this period, I also started reading <i>India
Today,</i> and was thrilled when I realized that the 
"Ninan" signature in their excellent graphics and political 
cartoons belonged to an artist with whom I was already 
familiar!
