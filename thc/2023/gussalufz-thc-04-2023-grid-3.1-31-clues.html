    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This puzzle's theme is the old fairy tale, <i>Jack and
the Beanstalk</i>.
</p>
<p>
Some of the thematic entries come straight out of the
famous verse from that story (shown in uppercase
below):
</p>
<blockquote>
Fee-FI-FO-fum!<br>
I SMELL the blood of an ENGLISHMAN.<br>
Be he alive, or be he DEAD,<br>
I'll grind his BONES to make my bread.
</blockquote>
<p>
The three-letter entry, FOE, is clued in terms of the
other, very similar three-letter entry, FIE. These
two thematic entries are not quite the same as in the
verse, but close enough.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, JACK, BEAN, and STALK are thematic
entries too. Finally, GIANT makes an appearance
as a nina, running across the sixth row from the
bottom.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle, like a lot of my puzzles, is a pangram. But
quite unlike most of my puzzles, this one happens to
have <i>five</i> occurrences of the letter J! A freak
coincidence (nicely thematic though, as J = Jack), but
one that made me work harder when clueing!
</p>
<p>
I had made a mistake in this crossword. 24 Across used the
word "husband" instead of "fellow," which would not have
worked.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
It's been a long, cold, wet winter here in California,
but spring is finally breaking through now. The first
blossom has appeared on the cherry tree that we planted
last year. The finches are back too, trying to revive
their successful nest from last year.
</p>
<p>
In line with the long dreary winter, the world at large
seems to be plodding through a long dreary era
compounded by all kinds of dunderheads in all kinds of
leadership positions, quite reaffirming Douglas Adams's
suspicion that we "... made a big mistake coming down
from the trees in the first place."
