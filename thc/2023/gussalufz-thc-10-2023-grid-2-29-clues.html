    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
ERNO RUBIK'S CUBE can be seen as a nina going across the 
fifth row from the top and continuing over the fifth row 
from the bottom.
</p>
<p>
The brilliant cube puzzle invented by Hungarian Ernő Rubik
has three rotating layers along each of the three axes.
It draws one in instantly, once one has spent even a few
minutes with it.
</p>
<p>
Three solution entries are themed around solving a Rubik's
cube: SOLVE (10A), SPEED (13A), STEPS (27A).
</p>
<p>
In addition, there are a few other tangential connections
to the theme. A COMBINATION LOCK (16A) is also a puzzle
of sorts, with lots of possible states. The two words LEFT
and BACK (8D) are the common names of two of a cube's
faces in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube#Singmaster_notation">Singmaster notation</a>
for cube moves. Coincidentally, four steps from a sequence
of moves written in the Singmaster notation can be seen in
the very top row (UUFD).
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
The Rubik's Cube holds a special place in my heart. I was
around 13, in the early eighties, and I had read about the
cube and wanted it really badly. We lived in Bhopal, and
nothing "imported" like that ever made it there in those
days. And yet, a few cubes showed up in a shop, and my late mother bought one for me on her way back from her school.
It was certainly a luxury item for our tight family budget
back then.
</p>
<p>
<i>Science Today</i>, a fantastic magazine from that era,
published a long article that described a solution
technique for the cube, around the time I got mine. It was
not the typical layer-wise algorithm that's commonly used.
It just described a very small number of sequences (two
for "edges" and two for "corners," if I remember correctly),
and that general mechanism where you come up with a prefix
of moves that will get the pieces in the right positions,
then you apply your set sequence, and then you undo the
prefix by reversing it. I can still remember the thrill
of solving the puzzle for the first time, using the simple
<i>Science Today</i> recipe!
</p>
<p>
Fast-forward a few years. 1990. On my first flight ever,
on my way to the U.S., Airport Security decided to go
through my handbag at London. They found my cube, which
was still a bit of a novelty. They said, can you solve it?
I said, I can do it in under a minute. They said, do it now!
A crowd gathered (yes, crowds could gather even at airport
security, back in the day!). And there was a big round of
applause, once I did solve it within a minute.
</p>
<p>
Fast-forward some more, and even today, that very Rubik's
cube still works just fine. It sits on the window ledge,
right across from where I sit for work every day in my
home office.
