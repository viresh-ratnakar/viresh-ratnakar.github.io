    <center><i>The Hindu Cryptic #13,878 from Tuesday, May 30, 2023</i></center>
  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The comedy group <i>Monty Python</i> forms the theme of
this puzzle. You can see MONTY as a nina running across
the 7th row from the top (straddling SERMON and
TYPEFACE), and PYTHON running down the middle column.
</p>
<p>
The following solution words are also connected to the theme:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The 1975 movie, <i>Monty Python and the Holy
Grail</i> is referenced by HOLY (8D) and GRAIL
(25A).
</li>
<li>
The bridgekeeper guarding the "Bridge of Death" in
that movie asks each seeker three QUESTIONs (23A).
</li>
<li>
One of John Cleese's most memorable performances
was in the famous sketch, <i>The Ministry of Silly
Walks</i>, featured in SILLY (24D) and WALKS (6D).
</li>
<li>
<i>Spam</i> (26D) is also a famous Python sketch.
</li>
</ul>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
Spring is here! Our one year old cherry tree had its
first blossom, and a finch duo is nesting again in the
well-shielded corner under the roof overhang that was
discovered by them last year.
</p>
<p>
There was a brief, completely unexpected hail storm
today. Weird weather patterns are here to stay, thanks
to climate change. My generation will likely be the
last one before climate-related crises become a
<i>huge, constant, never-ending</i> challenge for
humanity, sadly.
