  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This is my 50th cryptic crossword in the <i>Hindu</i>.
I am grateful for this platform and would like to thank
all solvers for giving my grids a go. All feedback is
always welcome and appreciated.
</p>
<p>
My acknowledgement of THANKS can be seen as a nina running
across the middle row. The word PACHAS, which means "fifty"
in Hindi, can be seen running down the middle column.
</p>
<p>
For variety and fun, I've tried to set an easier crossword
this time, deliberately (as stated by 14A's surface as well
as solution). I've tried to keep the entries relatively
simple, there are lots of hidden answers and anagrams, and
there are lots of words used directly in the wordplay (i.e.,
without using synonyms). This is likely a one-off 
variation, but perhaps I will repeat this stunt every now 
and then (depending on solvers' reactions).
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
While I am decidedly an atheist, I have picked up a habit
of attributing all good things in life to an unspecified
entity whom I call <i>Goddess</i>. I think this started
with me learning about how Ramanujan credited a goddess for
his acumen. Contrariwise, I attribute all mishaps and
problems—from hangnails to traffic jams—to an entity named
<i>Murphy</i> (yes, the "Murphy's Law" Murphy). I think
<i>Goddess and Murphy</i> would be a nice title for
a book :-).
</p>
<p>
This crossword gig with the <i>Hindu</i> has been A Very
Good Thing for me—Murphy has definitely been kept at bay.
For that, I thank Goddess, who makes an appearance in
the solution to 27A.
