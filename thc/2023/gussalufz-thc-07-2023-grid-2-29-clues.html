  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword's theme is "financial transactions,"
mostly of the questionable kind.
</p>
<p>
The preamble, "Covertly convert (13)" alludes to the theme,
once you substitute "MONEY" (the solution to 13A) for "13."
</p>
<p>
Running across the fifth row from the bottom is a nina
that reads "LAUNDER." In the second row from the top,
straddling the end of 9A and the beginning of 10A, there
is another thematic nina that reads "HAWALA."
</p>
<p>
In addition, with some latitude in some cases, the
following entries can be construed to be thematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li>13A. MONEY.</li>
<li>16A. FOREIGN EXCHANGE.</li>
<li>6D. PAWN.</li>
<li>15D. BEHIND BARS.</li>
<li>23D. ARREST.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>
<p>
Erratum: The published version of this crossword was
missing a T in the wordplay in 24A, as pointed out by
THCC reader <i>Economizer</i>.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
The first batch of cherries from our baby cherry tree
ripened, finally. There were only about a hundred or so
cherries, but they were spectacularly delicious! Looking
forward to next year's batch already.
