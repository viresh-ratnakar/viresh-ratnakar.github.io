    <b>Notes</b>

<p>
This crossword is cat-themed. CATS (19A), PAWS (14A), and
HELLO (7D, for <i>Hello Kitty</i>) are thematic entries.
</p>

<p>
At a stretch, SWEETIE (20D), ALBACORE (12A), SNOOZE (24A), HISS (25D),
and NODDERS (8D) can also be construed as cat-related. The
surface of 28A alludes to Dr. Seuss, who is the author of
the famous book, <i>The Cat in the Hat</i>.
</p>

<p>
GARFIELD and CHESHIRE can be seen as ninas, running across
the fourth row from the top and the fourth row from the 
bottom, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Both 7D and 18A use the phrase, "I say," as the definition.
This was a coincidence; but even after I noticed the repetition, I
still kept the clues as they were, as the two senses of the phrase
are quite different: an exclamatory <i>"I say!"</i> for 
HELLO! and an opinionated "I say" for IF YOU ASK ME.
</p>

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I set several clues in this crossword during a work
conference (<i>shh!</i>), and the surface of 18A is related 
to the conference. The grid itself was filled earlier, 
during a  time when I was corresponding with someone who is 
an author of a series of cat-themed novels.
