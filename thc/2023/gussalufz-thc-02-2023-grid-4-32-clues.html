  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword features SAVITRIBAI PHULE as a nina (running
across the fourth row from the top and continuing in the
second row from the bottom).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitribai_Phule">Savitribai
Phule</a> is one of India's greatest icons. She was an
educator who was way ahead of her times (19th century).
She pioneered women's education and was a brave champion for
caste-oppressed people in India.
</p>
<p>
The entries in 13a (RIGHTS), 14a (REFORMER), and 20a
(HEROIC) are connected with Savitribai Phule. The surface of
14a mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabhau_Sathe">Annabhau
Sathe</a>, another noted reformer from Maharashtra (20th
century).
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
Wrapped up setting this one after wrapping up my excellent
trip to London, Bangalore, Indore, and Bombay. I
successfully evaded the apparently extraordinary
California rainstorms thanks to my trip. Very sad about
the heartless and entirely avoidable tech layoffs that have
happened recently (some of my dear friends have been
affected).
