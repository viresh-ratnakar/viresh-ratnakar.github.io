  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
Running down the middle column, taking 5d, 12d, and 25d
in order, you can find the name of a James Bond film:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Another_Day">DIE
ANOTHER DAY</a>.
</p>
<p>
JAMES can be seen as a nina at the top of the first column,
and BOND is the solution to 15a. Pierce Brosnan played the
role of James Bond in <i>Die Another Day,</i> and PIERCE
is the solution to 27a.
</p>
<p>
Miss Moneypenny shows up in 8d: the solution is MONEY and
the first word in the clue is PENNY.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I finished setting this crossword in London, where I spent
new year's eve at a high-rise hotel with spectacular views
of the city's incredible fireworks display. By the time this
is published, I will be back in the US, but right now I'm
headed to India, looking forward to running the Mumbai
half marathon (and indulging in a LOT of good food!).
