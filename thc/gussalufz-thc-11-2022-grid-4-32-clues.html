    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
ASTERIX can be found as a  nina in this crossword, running
across the second row from the top, right to left.
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few entries connected to the wonderfully
punny world of the indomitable Gauls featured in
<i>Asterix</i> comics by Goscinny and Uderzo (originally
in French, spectacularly translated into English by the
late Anthea Bell).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
4d. RECIPE. Referring to Getafix's secret recipe for
magic potion.
</li>
<li>
5a. PIRATE. One of the hapless buccaneers that Asterix &amp; co.
run into at sea alarmingly frequently (for them!).
</li>
<li>
12a. PALISADE. The Gaul village has a robust palisade
around it.
</li>
<li> 14a. CAULDRON. </li>
<li> 17d. COMICS. </li>
<li> 19d. VILLAGE. </li>
<li> 20a. POTION. </li>
<li>
23a. OLYMPICS. <i>Asterix at the Olympic Games</i> was
was also made into a movie in 2008.
</li>
<li> 24d. MAGIC. </li>
<li>
26d. WOOF. A dignified remark from Dogmatix,
undoubtedly!
</li>
<li> 29a. FRENCH. </li>
<li> 30a. STRENGTH. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The surface of 16d. refers to Tintin, another star of a
wonderful series of comic books. Tintin and Asterix went
hand in hand for me while growing up.
</p>
<p>
This crossword landed at THC #13711, a number that is yet
again a reversible prime!
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
This time of the year is when my son's high school marching
band goes to various band competitions around the bay area,
every Saturday. I have been volunteering with them (got
my first ride on the huge semi-trailer truck that carries
all their equipment, as a result!).
</p>
<p>On October 15, 2022, the band performed in Gilroy,
California. By the time they got to perform, the weather
had turned quite chilly. High school stadiums typically
only have metal benches for the audience, and sitting on
the ice cold bench seemed quite an uninviting prospect to
me. Until ... I remembered that thanks to Douglas Adams,
I was carrying a massively useful item in my backpack:
<i>a towel!</i>
</p>
<p>In the memorable words of Douglas Adams:
<i>
A towel ... is about the most massively useful thing an
interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great
practical value—you can wrap it around you for warmth
as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can
lie on it on the brilliant marble sanded beaches of
Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can
sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on
the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft
down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in
hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off
noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous
Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal,
it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see
you—daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your
towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course
dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean
enough.
</i>
</p>
<p>
And you can use it to protect your underside from ice-cold
bleachers in high school stadiums on cold autumn evenings!
