  <b>Notes</b>
  <p>
  The theme of this crossword is an exceptional actress who excelled in
  the parallel art cinema of the seventies and eighties as well as in
  mainstream movies of that era. Her name is spelled out by a nina running
  across diagonally in the northwest and southeast quadrants:
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smita_Patil">SMITA PATIL</a>.
  An additional nina, running across the middle row, is SHAKTI, the name of
  one of her mainstream movies.
  </p>
  <p>
  Additionally, the following solutions and clue surfaces are thematic:
  <ul>
    <li>
      19a. The surface mentions the name of a famous Smita Patil film:
      <i>Bazaar</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
      28a. The surface can be seen as descriptive of Smita Patil.
    </li>
    <li>
      6d. The surface mentions the name of another famous Smita Patil film:
      <i>Umbertha</i>. The novel that the movie was based on actually had
      a different name.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  This puzzle is a pangram.
  </p>
  <p>
  9a originally read:
  <blockquote>
  Bus stop stalker seen regularly (7)
  </blockquote>
  I have revised the clue, as that construction was flawed: "stop" is not the
  same as "shut."
