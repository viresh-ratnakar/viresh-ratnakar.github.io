    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword is themed after the English computer
scientist,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan
Turing</a>. TURING can be seen as a nina running across
the middle row.
</p>
<p>
The following entries are connected to Alan Turing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
10a. LOGICAL. Turing got his PhD dissertation from
the Department of Mathematics at Princeton; his
dissertation was titled <i>Systems of Logic Based
on Ordinals</i>.
</li>
<li>
11a. ENIGMA. During World War II, Turing played a
crucial role in cracking intercepted messages that
had been encrypted using the German Enigma machine.
</li>
<li>
18a. PROGRAMMER.
</li>
<li>
24a. CHURCH. Alonzo Church was Turing's thesis advisor.
The idea that Turing machines and the lambda calculus
are capable of computing anything that can be computed
is known as the Church-Turing thesis.
</li>
<li>
8d &amp; 18d. HALTING PROBLEM. Turing proved that some
problems cannot be solved computationally by
constructing a simple example of such a problem, known
as the <i>Halting Problem</i>: given the specifications
for a computer program and an input for it, will that
computer program run forever on that input or will it
halt at some point?
</li>
<li>
24d. ATHLETE. Turing was an excellent athlete who
occasionally ran the 40 miles from Bletchley to London
when he was needed for meetings, and he was capable of
world-class marathon standards. The definition used
in the clue is the phrase "marathoner, maybe," which
certainly fits Turing.
</li>
<li>
25d. TEST. Turing proposed a test, now known as the
<i>Turing Test</i>, in which a human inquisitor would
judge whether the entity they are in conversation with
is a human or is an artificial intelligence.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have edited the surface of 19a. It originally read:
<i>"Characters shared by ..."</i> While "characters" might be
technically (and arguably!) sufficient to indicate
anagramming (in the sense of "set of characters," with
no ordering implied), the added adjective "Unusual"
indicates the anagramming explicitly and makes the
clue better and fairer. Many thanks to The Void for the
suggestion.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
As I finish setting this crossword, just a few days are
left for the critical midterm elections in the U.S.
Lula has been elected president of Brazil (thankfully!).
Twitter has taken over by a billionaire who seems to want
to 2d it! The league stage of the T20 World Cup has wrapped
up. Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, and Arshdeep Singh have
been the standout performers for India so far.
