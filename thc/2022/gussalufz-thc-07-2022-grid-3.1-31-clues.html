  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
Running down the unchecked cells in the last column, you can
spot the word ZEPPELIN. Together with 25d, it forms the
name of a famous rock music group as the nina:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin">LED
ZEPPELIN</a>. Band members Robert PLANT and Jimmy PAGE
appear as solutions to 21d and 9a, respectively. Aside:
the surface of 9a is autobiographically accurate.
</p>
<p>
STAIRWAY, at 1a, is the first word from the title of
Led Zeppelin's most famous song, <i>Stairway to Heaven</i>.
The word "graffiti" used in the surface of 20a is the
second half of the name of the album,
<i>Physical Graffiti</i>, by the group.
</p>
<p>
This crossword uses a new grid design, that will replace
the one that I used in my THC crossword #13,591, as that
grid had a few minor issues. I have taken the opportunity
to include two three-letter lights in this new grid.
Three-letter lights are not there in any other THC grid of
mine, so this also opens up some unexplored territory for
me. A minor celebration of that is seen in the solution to
8d, which is THREE.
</p>
<p>
The crossword landed on a prime number (13,633) again, but
thankfully not a third reversible prime in a row, as
that would have been a bit too uncanny :-).
<!--
I had a bit
more spare time during my vacations last month, so I have
another THC crossword waiting in line this month. Let's
see what number it gets!
-->
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
Good news on the finch front: it turns out that having lost
a nest, one of the finch families regrouped and built a
new nest in an even more hidden corner of my house's facade.
And they succeeded—a few beautiful and adorably demanding
finch chicks appeared in that nest! All have flown away now,
hopefully leading fun-filled finch lives.
