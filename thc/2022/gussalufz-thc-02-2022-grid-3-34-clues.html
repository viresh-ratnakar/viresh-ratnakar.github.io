    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword's theme is mathematics. Several clue
surfaces use numbers and there are ninas and solution
words that are mathematically themed (most are, specifically,
from abstract algebra).
The first nina is GALOIS, in the middle row.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Évariste
Galois</a> was a brilliant French mathematician
who established several breakthroughs in abstract algebra
before he died in a duel at the ridiculously young age of 20,
in 1832.
</p>
<p>
The second nina is NOETHER, running down the 6th column.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether">Emmy
Noether</a> (1882-1935) was a genius German mathematician. Her
wide-ranging work has been foundational in abstract algebra,
which is an incredible achievement, given all the systemic hurdles
that she faced as a woman.
</p>
<p>
The following solution words are thematic (the starred ones
are from abstract algebra):
</p>
<ul>
<li>7d. GROUP*</li>
<li>14a. DIAMETER</li>
<li>16a. DOMAIN*</li>
<li>18d. ORDERING</li>
<li>26d. PRIME*</li>
<li>30a. ALGEBRA*</li>
<li>31a. GREATER</li>
</ul>
<p>
Several clue surfaces use numbers. While reaffirming the crossword theme,
this was also a nod to the <i>Guardian</i> setter Qaos, whose clues often
feature numbers, as this crossword was set shortly after I was involved in
recording an
<a href="https://offgrid.tlmb.net/2021/12/19/universally-sized-ep-13/">Off-Grid
podcast episode</a> that was centred around a Qaos crossword.
Here are all the clues whose surfaces use numbers:
</p>
<blockquote>
1d, 4d, 5a, 5d, 7d, 10a, 14a, 17d, 18d, 19a, 22d, 25a,
26d, 27d, 28a, 31a. 
</blockquote>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
