    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword has three hidden ninas. These ninas, together
with four solution words that are located appropriately form
the theme of this puzzle: BIRYANI (which is also a nina
running across the sixth row from the top).
</p>
<p>
There are two occurrences of the same nina, RICE, in the
third row from the top and in the fifth row from the bottom.
These two RICE "layers" and a few solution entries (also
situated along biryani-like layers) complete the theme.
These thematic, layered solution entries are: ONION (1a),
MINT (19a), SAFFRON (27a), and the bottom layer of CURRY
(29a).
</p>
<p>
With some latitude, these additional solution words and clue
surfaces can also be seen as thematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li>1a. The surface refers to eating.</li>
<li>10a. ICE CUBE.</li>
<li>11a. The surface alludes to food.</li>
<li>14a. SLOW. The best biryanis are slow-cooked!</li>
<li>15a. MAIN COURSE. Additionally, the surface refers
to "bean casserole."</li>
<li>22a. DAIQUIRI</li>
</ul>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
<i>I am going to start noting a few
personal "what-was-on-my-mind-at-the-time" notes in my
post-solve explanations. You may find them somewhat
amusing/interesting, or you may choose to completely
ignore them—they are going to be diary-like indulgences
for future-me to chuckle at or raise my eyebrows at.</i>
</p>
<p>
A substantial part of this crossword was constructed in
the waiting room of Boston's Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital,
while waiting for my daughter's ankle surgery to be
finished (she is fine now). Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson
was confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court by the U.S. Senate
while I sat waiting and cheering.
