  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword bids adieu to the year gone by. There is a
nina (in the fourth column from the right) that reads,
BYE ZOZZ. "ZOZZ," of course, is meant to be squinted at,
to get a passable imitation of 2022 :-).
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a <i>double</i> pangram: every letter of the
alphabet appears at least twice in the solution, which is
again a nod to 2022, the year that has an abundance of
"2"s.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the puzzle is nearly a <i>triple</i> pangram—as
another little homage to 2022, 22 letters appear at least
3 times in the solution.
</p>
<p>
Fitting in so many "J"s, "Q"s, "Z"s, etc. made it hard
to create any thematic entries, and there aren't any. The
surfaces of 5d and 6d allude to the end of the year and
the beginning of a new year, respectively.
</p>
<p>
I try to not repeat an indicator word within a crossword, but
"cut" (for omitting the last letter) slipped through in this one,
making an appearance in both 9a and 19a.
</p>
<p>
Finally, yet again, a crossword of mine has landed on a number that is a reversible
prime! Both 13751 and 15731 are prime numbers.
</p>
<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
Autumn is in full swing here; leaves have gone through
incredible shades of red and yellow and are now mostly
brown and falling. It's the best time of the year,
according to Oona, my 7-year-old dog. She loves to stand
under a large tree in my neighbourhood, waiting for large
clusters of leaves to fall. It's not the leaves themselves
that actually interest her—it's their shadows. These wispy
shadows dart across the ground, kindling a deep-rooted
hunting instinct in her, as she probably imagines them
to be a fierce and/or edible swarm of creatures scampering
around! Here's an obligatory
<a href="https://twitter.com/vireshratnakar/status/1518410046236897280/photo/2">link to an Oona pic</a>.
</p>
<p>
Wishing everyone a happy new year, one filled with
dogs and cats and other good things.
