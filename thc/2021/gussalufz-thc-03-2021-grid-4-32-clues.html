  <b>Notes</b>
  <p>
  There are two ninas in this crossword. Down the 4<sup>th</sup> column from
  the right, you can see the word
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua">OUMUAMUA</a>.
  ʻOumuamua is an interstellar object that passed through our solar
  system in 2017, entering it from north of the plane of the ecliptic
  (the plane of Earth's orbit). ECLIPTIC is the other nina, running
  across the fourth row from the bottom. The relative positions of the
  two ninas roughly depicts the arrival trajectory of the object.
