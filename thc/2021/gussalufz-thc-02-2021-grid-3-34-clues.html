    There are two ninas in the grid. MIYAZAKI (the hidden "drawer")
    can be seen running down the 14<sup>th</sup> column, and MONONOKE
    can be seen running down the 2<sup>nd</sup> column.

    Miyazaki</a> is a legendary creator of beautiful animated
    movies including Princess Mononoke.

    <li> 24d. "Leading director and exceptional animator" in the surface
         describes Miyazaki.</li>
  </ul>
