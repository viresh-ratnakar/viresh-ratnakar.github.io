  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
There is a nina running across the top row and the
fifth-from-the-bottom row: GRADIENT DESCENT. Gradient
descent is a key algorithm used in artificial intelligence
(which is the theme in this crossword, cryptically seen in the
  title as "Br<b>ai</b>ny, Essentially")). Gradient descent is
used for training computational neural networks to
recognize patterns found in large data sets.
</p>
<p>
The following clues and solution entries are thematic:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
10a. PRIOR is also a technical term, referring to
the starting point of knowledge encoded in a system, before
it is made to learn from training data.
</li>
<li>
11a. SHUFFLE is what you have to do to training data, to
make sure that the network learns patterns inherent in the
data rather than any patterns in the ordering of the
data.
</li>
<li>
14a. NON-LINEAR functions are often used as
computational "neurons" that make deep-learning networks
powerful by being able to handle complex patterns in data.
</li>
<li>
14a. The surface itself describes a deep learning neural
network.
</li>
<li>
15a. MACHINE LEARNING is the broad name for the key
area of artificial intelligence that concerns training
computer systems using data.
</li>
<li>
16a. The surface refers to A.I.
</li>
<li>
25d. DEEP is the adjective that's part of "deep learning,"
that has revolutionized A.I. using deep stacks of computational
neurons.
</li>
<li>
28a. The surface refers to the workings of a neural network.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, 7d. (NIBBLE), 12a. (USEABLE), 13a. (PULSE),
18d. (IDENTITY), and 28a. (ORDINATES) also have technical
interpretations that can be construed (at a stretch) to fit
the theme.
