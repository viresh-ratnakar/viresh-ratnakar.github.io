    <b>Notes</b>
<p>    
Cryptic crossword wordplay is the theme of this crossword.
There is a nina running across the second row from the top
and the second row from the bottom, that reads, WORDPLAY
ELEMENTS.
</p>
<p>The following solutions words are all used as wordplay
elements in cryptic crosswords:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>5d. SPOONERISM.</li>
  <li>8d. SYNONYM.</li>
  <li>13d. PALINDROME.</li>
  <li>19a. PUNS.</li>
  <li>24a. JUMBLE.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the surfaces of 24a and 27a are connected to
cryptic crosswords.
</p>
<p>
The title is a play on a funny line I remember from a <i>Fawlty Towers</i>
episode ("Pretentious, mois?").
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
