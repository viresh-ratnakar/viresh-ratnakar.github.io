    <b>Notes</b>

<p>
The theme of this crossword is Bill Watterson's much-loved
cartoon strip, <i>Calvin and Hobbes,</i> about the
adorably precocious little boy Calvin and his
philosophical stuffed tiger, Hobbes.
</p>

<p>
CALVIN can be spotted in a nina running up the middle column,
and HOBBES is a nina in the middle row. SUSIE is a nina
running down diagonally in the northeast corner (Susie
Derkins is Calvin's favourite frenemy), and
SPIFF is a nina rinning down diagonally in the southwest
corner (Spaceman Spiff is one of Calvin's favourite alter
egos).
</p>

<p>
In addition, the surfaces of these two clues are thematic:
</p>

<ul>
<li>10d. The surface refers to Calvin and Hobbes and
Watterson.</li>
<li>27a. The surface might be seen as talking about
Hobbes.</li>
</ul>
