My 25th crossword for The Hindu Cryptic!
</p>
<p>
5d is TWENTY-FIVE, and 25d is GRID. GRID's clue number is
25, enabling the cryptic definition in 5d.
</p>
<p>
There are two ninas in the puzzle:
THANK YOU (second-last column), and THE HINDU
(fourth column). Indeed, many thanks to the <i>Hindu</i> and
to all you solvers who have been my partners across this
rewarding journey of whimsy and wordplay over the last
twenty-five months.
</p>
<p>
In 27a, "the first level" is used to indicate "L." I have
learned to stay away from this construction as it's generally
not viewed as correct ("the first of ..." or "... at first"
are acceptable). However, in this case I gave in, as the surface seemed
too attractive, and solvers are generally able to parse this
construction anyway as many setters use it.
</p>
<p>
The last across clue (29a) and the last down clue (25d)
can be seen as a dialogue between a
solver and a setter. 
Both the clues use "finally" as a letter-picking
indicator—I try to avoid such duplication generally,
but in this case I found the idea of having similar
surfaces for both clues appealing
(they are both the final clues of their sort too!).
</p>
<p>
The puzzle is a pangram. In fact, it is <i>almost</i> a
double pangram—all letters other than Q occur at least twice
in the solution entries. All letters other than Q add up to
<i>twenty-five</i> in number.
