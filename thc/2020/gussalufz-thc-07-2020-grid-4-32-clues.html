  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
    <p>
    The theme of this puzzle is "Black Lives Matter," the solution to 25a
    (together with 24d and 10d).
    The title, <i>Dr. Who?</i> (seemingly referring to the surface of 25a), is
    a nod to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
    Additionally, the following clues are thematic:
    </p>
    <p>
    There is a nina running down the second and tenth columns that reads: WE
    SHALL OVERCOME.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The surface of 1d refers to racism in the police force.</li>
      <li>The surface of 3d asks for a non-racist (police) force.</li>
      <li>The surface of 14a refers to the civil rights movements.</li>
      <li>The surface of 16d refers to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s historic
          march from Selma, along with John Lewis.</li>
    </ul>
