  <b>Notes</b>
  <p>
  The theme of the crossword is the solution to 16a, "Waiting for Godot,"
  the famous play by Samuel Beckett. There are two ninas: VLADIMIR running
  across the top row and ESTRAGON running across the third row from the
  bottom. Vladimir and Estragon are the two man characters in Waiting for Godot.
  </p>
  <p>
  Additionally, the following clues are thematic:
  <ul>
  <li>14a is a CD that refers to the famous monologue in the play.</li>
  <li>The surface of 20d refers to “Samuel’s play” (and also to Ulysses, the famous work by a fellow Irish author, James Joyce).</li>
  </ul>
