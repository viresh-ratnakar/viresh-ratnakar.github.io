  exolve-explanations:
  <b>Notes</b>
  <p>
  The nina, HAZAARON KHWAISHEIN AISI, is the name of an excellent Hindi movie.
  The title uses the name of the poet (Ghalib) who wrote the ghazal with the
  same name. The Hindi word (<i>Tera</i>, "13") in the title additionally plays on
  the fact that there are a lot of "13"s here (the number of the crossword is
  13,013 and it was published on August 13).
  </p>
  <p>
  The surfaces of the following clues are also related to the thematic movie:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>7d. Geeta is the name of the character played by Chitrangda Singh in the
  movie.</li>
  <li>8d. The word “emergency” is used—the movie is set in the background of
  the infamous state of emergency in India in the mid 70s.</li>
  <li>14a. Sudhir Mishra is the director of the movie.</li>
  <li>30a. Chitrangda Singh is the lead actress in the movie.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  This puzzle is a pangram.
