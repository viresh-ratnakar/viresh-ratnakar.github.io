  <b>Notes</b>
  <p>
  The theme of this grid is computer programming. There are two ninas: SOFTWARE and CODING. In addition, the following solution words are thematic:
  <ul>
  <li>9A. PRIVATE</li>
  <li>13A. CACHED</li>
  <li>20A. RETURN</li>
  <li>23A. VARIABLE</li>
  <li>25A. CLASS</li>
  <li>6D. FLOAT</li>
  <li>7D. ITERATE</li>
  <li>8D. ELSE</li>
  <li>10D. SWITCH</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  The published version of this crossword used the word "change" instead of
  "switch" in 25a. I think "switch" works better.
  </p>
