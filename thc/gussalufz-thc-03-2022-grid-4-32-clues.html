    <b>Notes</b>

<p>
The theme of this crossword is <i>The Expanse</i>, a series
of science fiction novels by James S. A. Corey, as well as
a spectacular TV series.
</p>

<p>
Running down the 9th column, you can find EXPANSE as a nina.
Running down the 6th column is SHOHREH: another nina, which
is the first name of the brilliant actress,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohreh_Aghdashloo">Shohreh
Aghdashloo</a>, who plays the role of UN Secretary General
Chrisjen Avasarala in the TV show.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the following solution entries are thematic:
</p><ul>
<li> 2d. GRAVITY.</li>
<li> 6d. SPACE. </li>
<li> 8d. MARS. </li>
<li> 11a. SHIPS.</li>
<li> 21d. DRUMMER. </li>
<li> 26d. BELT. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>

<p>
The clue for 14a, as originally published, had a mistake. It
read:
  <blockquote>
  14 Follow-up query when tax is misappropriated (4,4)
  </blockquote>
The anagram in this was missing a T. Being a Sunday THC,
this crossword was only published online, and the clue was
amended shortly after the error was spotted (I was alerted
about the mistake by Abhishek Sridhar on The Hindu
Crossword Corner blog).
