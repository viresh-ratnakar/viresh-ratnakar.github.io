  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>

<p>
This puzzle is a <i>double</i> pangram: each letter of the
alphabet appears two or more times across all the solution
entries.
</p>

<p>
DOUBLE PANGRAM is also spelled out by a nina running down
the middle column and across the second row from the top.
</p>

<p>
The word "two" appears twice in the clues.
</p>

<p>
The published version of this crossword used the word "animals" instead of "dolts"
in 30a. That was an error, as the plural of OX the animal is OXEN, not OXES. OXES
is the plural of OX in the sense of "dolt."
