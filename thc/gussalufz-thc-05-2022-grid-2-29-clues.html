    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
This crossword showcases a favourite author of mine (likely
a favourite author of many solvers too): Sir Pelham
Grenville Wodehouse.
</p>
<p>
WOOSTER (Bertram/Bertie Wooster, one of Wodehouse's best
known and most loved characters) can be seen as a nina
running down the 14th column). Wodehouse's nickname, PLUM,
can be seen as a nina in the third row from the bottom.
</p>
<p>
In addition (with some latitude), the following clues or
solutions can be construed as thematic:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    1d. A RAFFLE seems like the sort of thing that would
    be a commonplace occurrence in Wodehouse's idyllic
    world. I only found one substantial reference to it
    though: in the short story <i>Jeeves and the unbidden
    guest</i>, Rollo the dog fancies a bite of Bertie's
    leg. Rollo was won by Lord Motty Pershore at a raffle.
  </li>
  <li>
    2d. The surface is the sort of thing that Jeeves might
    say to Bertie.
  </li>
  <li>
    4d. The DRONES club is the preferred hangout for
    Wodehouse's rich young gentlemen, such as Cyril "Barmy"
    Fotheringay-Phipps, Charles Edward "Biffy" Biffen, and,
    of course, Bertram "Bertie" Wooster.
  </li>
  <li>
    16a. GOOD-NATUREDNESS is a key trait of most of the
    non-villainous characters in the Wodehouse universe.
    Even the villains usually turn out to have some
    soft spots!
  </li>
  <li>
    16d. GROGGIER is how you might feel in the morning,
    after an adventurous night out with Wodehouse's
    characters. Of course, a <i>pick-me-up</i> concoction
    by Jeeves would fix you up!
  </li>
  <li>
    17d. The surface paints the picture of a
   Jeeves-like butler.
  </li>
  <li>
    18d. The surface refers to a perfectly good hat being
    discarded, perhaps an act triggered by Jeeves!
  </li>
  <li>
    22a. AUNTS figure prominently in a lot of Plum's works,
    especially Bertie's aunts!
  </li>
  <li>
    25d. The surface refers to Bertie and Jeeves.
  </li>
  <li>
    26a. UNROBED is how one might find one of
    Wodehouse's hapless characters in the middle of a story.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>

<p>
The published version of this crossword used the phrase
"a minor piece" for "pawn" in 10a. I've been told that
only the bishop and the knight can technically be called
"minor" pieces in chess. I've altered the clue to say
"a lowly piece" now.
</p>

<p>
<b>Personal notes:</b>
Back home from Boston, and back to work at the office now,
three days a week (not really thrilled about that). Three
wild finch nests got built in the backyard, and sadly, all
three got blown away in a windstorm. The young cherry
tree that we planted in the front yard is doing well in its
first Spring.
