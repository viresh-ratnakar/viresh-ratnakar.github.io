    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
The theme of this crossword is that delightful old story,
<i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, by Lewis Carroll.
ALICE can be seen as a nina running across the 9th row from
the top, and CARROLL is a nina in the 11th row.
</p>

<p>
The following entries are thematic:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>1d. HEARTS.</li>
  <li>3d. RABBIT HOLE.</li>
  <li>10a. QUEEN.</li>
  <li>20d. GARDEN.</li>
  <li>24a. HERB TEA. Sure, only the second word is
      thematic :-).</li>
</ul>

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I finished setting this crossword on August 31, the day my
son Kavi turned 16. While he forbade me from making a big
fuss on any social media, he has no visibility into this
outlet of expression for me, for now :-). So, this is where
I can freely say how happy I am at how he has grown, and
how dearly I wish for him (and my daughter!) to experience
maximally idyllic and happy moments, to enjoy a lifetime
filled with curiosity and wonder, not entirely unlike that
summer afternoon was for Alice!
