  exolve-explanations:
   <b>Notes</b>
   <p>
   Solutions to clues numbered 3, 4, and 5 are HEIGHT, BASE, and HYPOTENUSE,
   respectively. The numbers 3, 4, and 5 fit correspondingly into the
   Pythagorean theorem: 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 5<sup>2</sup>
   (<i>a "power"ful relationship</i>).

   This crossword, the last one published in that decade,  marked my debut
   with The Hindu Cryptic.
   </p>
   <p>
   <i>Post-publication edits:</i> I changed "some" to "a bit of" in 10A,
   as I now find "some"
   somewhat unfair as a first-letter-picking indicator. 25A used to have
   "a bit of," which I changed to "a touch of," to avoid duplication.
