  <b>Notes</b>
  <p>
  The theme of this grid is physics. There are two thematic ninas:
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday">FARADAY</a>
  and PHYSICS. In addition, the following solutions are thematic:
  <ul>
  <li>16A. RELATIVE DENSITY.</li>
  <li>22A. LIGHT.</li>
  <li>6D. MASS.</li>
  <li>7D. RADIUM.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  A secondary theme (that got created unintentionally, in fact), is food.
  The following clues/solutions fall under this:
  <ul>
  <li>9A. The surface refers to "tofu pakora."</li>
  <li>11A. The solution refers to sandwiches and salad, and the solution
      is ROMAINE.</li>
  <li>12A. The solution refers to salmon, tuna, etc., and the solution
      is SASHIMI.</li>
  <li>24A. ALFALFA.</li>
  <li>28A. The surface refers to bread, and the solution is CROISSANT.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
