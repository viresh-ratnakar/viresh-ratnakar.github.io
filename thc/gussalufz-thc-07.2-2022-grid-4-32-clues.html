  exolve-explanations:
    <b>Notes</b>
<p>
KISI SE NA KEHNA is seen as a nina in this crossword,
running across the sixth row from the top and continuing in
the second row from the bottom. It's the title of a 1983
Hindi movie that has been in the news recently.
</p>
<p>
The movie title's English translation, for those who might
have looked for other thematic elements, is: DON'T TELL
ANYONE.
</p>
<p>
This puzzle is a pangram.
</p>

<b>Prime time, again!</b>
<p>
Quite incredibly, just like last month when my crossword landed at THC #13591,
this month's THC serial number, <b>13619</b> is also a reversible prime (that
is, both 13619 and 91631 are prime numbers)! I think the chance of <i>two</i>
random numbers in this neighbourhood being both reversible primes is about
one in ten thousand (perhaps some expert can chime in with a more precise
estimate?).
</p>

<b>Personal notes</b>
<p>
I've greatly enjoyed two outings over the last month:
Lugano, Switzerland, and then Boston (again!). Especially
relished a long hilly/lakey run in Lugano and a rivery one
in Boston (and Cambridge). And a few hours before submitting
this, ran the San Francisco Half Marathon, sporting a bib
that vainly bore the name "Gussalufz" :-). The curious can
search and find a picture on Twitter.
