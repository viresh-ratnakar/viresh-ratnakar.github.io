<p>
Exet is free, open source software for setting crosswords.
You can use Exet from my site, <a target="_blank"
  href="https://exet.app">exet.app</a> or you can download and use your own
copy of the software from the
<a target="_blank"
  href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exet">Exet GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
Exet comes with a permissive MIT license. The full license notice is provided
at the bottom of this page.
</p>

<p>
Exet has no library/package/software dependencies. You should be able to use
it from any modern browser. The experience may not be great on smaller screens
like phones, though.
</p>

<p>
Exet saves all revisions of all crosswords that you work on, in the browser's
local storage.  Exet never sends your crosswords to wherever it is getting
served from.
</p>

<p>
You can download the crosswords that you create with Exet in the
<a target="_blank"
  href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve">Exolve</a> format
or in the .puz format.
You can also grab embeddable HTML code for adding your crossword to any web
site or blog, using Exolve (but see the
<a target="_blank"
  href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve#exolve-widget">known caveats
in the Exolve documentation</a>).
</p>

<p>
As of September 2020, Exet only suggests English grid-fills (I'll add
support for other languages eventually).
</p>

<p>
I welcome <a target="_blank"
  href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exet/issues/new">bug
  reports and feature requests</a>. You may contact me via email too, at
viresh at gmail dot com.

<h3>UKACD18</h3>

<p>
The lexicon used by Exet for providing grid-fill suggestions is a modified
version of the "UKACD" words list, which comes with its own copyight notice
that is reproduced below. I made the following modifications to the UKACD words
list:
<ul>
  <li>Removed a few swear words.</li>
  <li>Replaced all accented characters with non-accented ones.</li>
  <li>Deleted all punctuation characters other than spaces, hyphens,
      and apostrophes.</li>
  <li>Attached a popularity score to each word/phrase using a dump of all of
      Wikipedia's English-language articles.</li>
  <li>Created an index of the lexicon suitable for use by my JavaScript
      code. Source code for the last two steps is available in my
      <a target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/lufz">Lufz GitHub
        repository</a>.</li>

</ul>
