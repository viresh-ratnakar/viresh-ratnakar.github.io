  exolve-preamble:
    The twelve Down entries in the six central columns of the grid are one
    letter too long for their spaces. Before entering them, one letter must be
    removed from the answer and placed in the gray cell directly above or
    below that entry. Crossing answers will help you determine which letter
    needs to be removed. All other entries are entered across/down as normal.
    When you've finished, the letters in the gray cells will cryptically
    describe the task you've been completing.
