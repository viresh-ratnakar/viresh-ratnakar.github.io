  exolve-prelude:
    <p>
    In eight clues, the definition parts have been replaced by the words
    “Al’s Trick.” Once you’ve figured out Al’s Trick, you can replace each
    “Al’s Trick” in these eight clues with one of the eight words revealed in
    the puzzle by applying Al’s Trick.
    </p>
    <p>
    Al's Trick is a technique for altering what a printed sheet of paper depicts. Here’s a down clue that reveals what Al’s Trick is:
    <blockquote>
    If held upside-down, sneaking old man finally reveals Al’s Trick (4-2)
    </blockquote>
    Once you enter the right solution to this clue in the designated space
    under the grid, you might even be able to see Al’s Trick in action!
    </p>
    <p>
    Al’s Trick has been a regular feature in X Y for over 55 years.
    Discerning solvers can also find the words X and Y in this puzzle.
    </p>

  exolve-explanations:
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
    I had started work on this grid quite a while back. The "MAD Fold-In" connection possibility
    had suggested itself inevitably to me, when I was thinking of ideas for my last 1ACross
    grid for the year, trying to stick to some sort of a visual theme. In fact, the prospect
    of animating the grid to show the Fold-In in action was a bit of a motivator for Exolve.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the middle of setting this grid, I learned of the sad closure of MAD Magazine. What
    a loss! Hats off to the team, and especially to Al Jaffee, who will turn a hundred years
    old in a couple of years, and who has spent his years fabulously, creating MAD Fold-Ins
    through over 55 years of his life.
