    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
    I had started work on this grid quite a while back. The "MAD Fold-In" connection possibility
    had suggested itself inevitably to me, when I was thinking of ideas for my last 1ACross
    grid for the year, trying to stick to some sort of a visual theme. In fact, the prospect
    of animating the grid to show the Fold-In in action was a bit of a motivator for Exolve.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the middle of setting this grid, I learned of the sad closure of MAD Magazine. What
    a loss! Hats off to the team, and especially to Al Jaffee, who will turn a hundred years
    old in a couple of years, and who has spent his years fabulously, creating MAD Fold-Ins
    through over 55 years of his life.
