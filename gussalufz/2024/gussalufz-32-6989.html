<center>
Connecting two entries of a kind will provide positional guidance for
finding two headlines and their whereabouts in history.

I had opened up this puzzle for online submissions in Frbruary 2024.
The first all correct entry was from <b>The Void</b>. The next two solvers
who answered the meta questions substantially correctly were
<b>Narayan Mandyam</b> and <b>Mona Sogal</b>. The first entry that
had the grid fully correct (but not the meta answers) was from <b>F</b>.
You can see selected feedback from solvers after clicking on
"Reveal All."
</i>
  exolve-question: First headline? (5,3) NIXON WON
  exolve-question: Second headline? (4,7) MOON MISSION
  exolve-question: Their historical whereabouts? (15)* 68, 69
  exolve-explanations:
Connecting the only two three-letter entries,
ROT (12A) and ATE (28A), forms <i>ROTATE.</i>
That is the "positional guidance"
that needs to be followed. After you rotate the solved
crossword by 180°, you can spot two ninas:
<ul>
<li>NIXON WON, running across the middle row.</li>
<li>MOON MISSION, running down the 6th and 10th
columns.</li>
</ul>
These are the two seminal headlines that the preamble
alludes to. The events happened in 1968 and 1969,
respectively, and these "whereabouts in history" can be
seen in the title as "68/69," after the crossword is
rotated.

<p>
By an incredible coincidence, first spotted by
The Void, the word NEIL can be seen
above MOON, after the grid is rotated!
</p>

<p><b>Feedback</b></p>
<p>
This puzzle proved to be very tough, especially the meta.
I did not get as many submissions as I normally do, and
I also got several notes from solvers who were struggling
(and ultimately did not submit).
Many thanks to everyone who gave it a go!
I'm copying some selected feedback below.

<ul id="feedback">
<li><b>Lakshmi Prakash.</b> Fantastic grid. Found the bonus questions tougher than the grid itself.</li>
<li><b>Mona Sogal.</b> Good brain exercise.</li>
<li><b>N Rengaswamy.</b> Enjoyed solving. Some tough ones.</li>
<li><b>primaldual.</b> 13 across was surprising, as I'm sure you intended—I was amused by it, others might not. As for the meta, I got the Nixon one literally as I was writing this admission of failure to get it even after rotating—never give up!</li>
<li><b>The Void.</b> Nice idea. Was NEIL on the MOON deliberately? :-)</li>
<li><b>Venkatraghavan S.</b> Lovely puzzle.</li>
