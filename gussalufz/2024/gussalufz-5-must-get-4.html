  exolve-preamble:

<b>Notes</b>
<p>
The names of some bugs need to be eliminated from five of the entries. The solution to 4a is DEBUGGED, and the title is meant to be interpreted as: <i>five (entries) must get de"bug"ged.</i>
</p>

<p>
The five eliminated bugs are BEE (1d), MOTH (7d), LICE (16d), FLY (25a), and ANT (30a). These bug names can be seen as ninas in the grid.
</p>

<p>
The letters from the bug names can be anagrammed to create the extra clue in Question 5 (it's a hidden-answer clue, with the solution TEAM).
</p>

<p>
It took a while for the first all-correct entry to show up, mostly because
Question 5 was not answered correctly. Laci, followed by The Void, were the first two
to turn in fully correct grids (both missed just Question 5).
NARU was the first one to answer Question 5 correctly (but missed out because of Question 3).
Mona Sogal turned in an entry with all questions answered correctly but had a typo in the grid.
</p>

<p>
I had a really hard time coming up with a cryptic clue that used exactly the eliminated letters.
I had asked solvers to try the exercise themselves, but nobody did (you can still try, and please let me know if you can construct something nicer!).
Some folks did turn in some fun clues for TEAM, and there was one letter bank clue for all the eliminated words:
</p>
<div id="solver-clues">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Laci</td>
    <td>"Quite amusing!", clutch side (4)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mona Sogal</td>
    <td>Group of termites, earwigs, alderflies, &amp; mantis basically (4)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mona Sogal</td>
    <td>Five disease carriers extracted from Bay Finch Motel perhaps used often (4,3,3,4,3)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Steve Allen</td>
    <td>Inmate a mate inside? (4)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Void</td>
    <td>Side picked from dissolute amateurs (4)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>VENKATESAN P.</td>
    <td>Group of steamboats (4)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<ul id="feedback">
<li><b>Ashit Hegde.</b> Great Fun</li>
<li><b>Jacquiline Singh.</b> The crossword was a mixed bag. Most of the clues were challenging and had excellent surface. A couple of them commanded guess work, like 12 and 30.</li>
<li><b>Kiran.</b> Similar to the eliminated words, there is the word EROS that is hidden in the grid. EROS could mean a type of winged beetle. I thought this was also an eliminated word!!</li>
<li><b>KK.</b> Tough but had fun solving it</li>
<li><b>Laci.</b> Fun as always</li>
<li><b>Mona Sogal.</b></li>
<li><b>N Anantakrishnan.</b> Lovely puzzle!</li>
<li><b>NARU.</b> PRETTY GOOD</li>
<li><b>ogl22b Brahmakulam.</b></li>
<li><b>Ramki Krishnan.</b> Nice workout! After I found a couple of clues where letters were to be dropped, got the theme.</li>
<li><b>samit kallianpur.</b> Challenging grid with a good theme.</li>
<li><b>Shashwat.</b> Super fun. Kinda challenging while staying well within accessible territory</li>
<li><b>Steve Allen.</b> Only spotted your post 2 hours ago and have run out of time. But enjoyed the experience, thanks.</li>
<li><b>The Void.</b> Faves, 6, 9, 17, 20a, 21. Not encountered the PLATE-less answer in 22 before. TIL.</li>
<li><b>VENKATESAN P.</b> Excellent puzzle.</li>
