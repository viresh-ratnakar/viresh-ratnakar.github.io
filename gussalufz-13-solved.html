  exolve-prelude:
    <p>
    Filling the grid by trusting the numbered clues will work almost
    everywhere. In a couple of cases though, such trust would be misplaced.
    For these exceptions, the setter has (elsewhere in the grid) provided
    pointers to point out what needs to be done. Stare at the grid, squinting
    if necessary, to find the pointers.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once you've figured out what needs to be done, you can also fill in the
    first two blanks below (indicated by question marks). The third blank is
    supplied by Nina.
    </p>
    <p>
    The conversation that follows might be an example of another ?????? ??????
    exchange, this one taking place between ???????.
    <blockquote>
        "Please 17 the 15!"<br/>
        "Please be 16!"<br/>
        "Hmph! 1d!?"

  exolve-question: What three words fit in “... ______ ______ exchange, this one taking place between _______”? (6,6,7) HEATED VERBAL SPOUSES

  exolve-explanations:
    <h3>Explanations</h3>
    <p>
    Filling the grid requires swapping VERBAL (10a) and HEATED (5a). This is
    pointed out by the black two-sided arrow running diagonally in the grid:
    the contents of the squares at the two ends of the arrow are X and V,
    pointing out that 10 and 5 need to be swapped.
    </p>
    <p>
    The nina is: SPOUSES.
    </p>
    <p>
    So, the blanks get filled like this:
    <blockquote>
    <i>
    This conversation might be an example of another HEATED VERBAL exchange,
    this one taking place between SPOUSES.
    </i>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
    The conversation gets revealed to be this:
    <blockquote>
    <i>
    "Please CLEAN the DISHES!"<br/>
    "Please be PATIENT!"<br/>
    "Hmph! ATTITUDE!?"
    </i>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
    My first 1AC grid of 2019 (Fifteen Puzzles) had used the visual appearance
    of a part of the grid as an instruction to the solver. In that grid, the
    top-left 4×4 part and the bottom-right 4×4 part looked like “15 puzzles”
    thereby conveying the instruction that the solver had to scramble the
    letters in those parts.
    </p>
    <p>
    When I began setting the next grid, I decided to try and make this a theme
    for all my 1AC grids for this year. For this grid, I was playing with
    patterns that I could create in the grid that satisfied both these
    conditions: (1) The pattern had to have some cryptic semantics, i.e., it
    could be interpreted as an instruction, and (2) The grid had to follow the
    standard rules of symmetry etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    Looking through the revision history of the spreadsheet that I used for
    setting, I pretty much started with the “arrow” shape. The first iteration
    had two additional single-sided arrows parallel to the diagonal
    double-sided one, and I was thinking about using them to indicate that the
    entire third row had to be swapped with the thirteenth row. But the
    resulting grid did not seem satisfactory: it had too many three-letter
    words, and the swapping instruction seemed vague as the two parallel
    single-sided arrows did not quite begin from the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once I dropped the two parallel arrows, the double-sided diagonal arrow
    seemed to have reasonably clear semantics, in the sense that it clearly
    went to-and-fro between the cells at (3,3) and (13,13). I could use it to
    indicate that the contents of those two cells needed to be swapped. But the
    grid constraints at this point meant that both (3,3) and (13,13) had to be
    parts of two words each, and coming up with four words that had a letter
    that could be swapped in just the right place, creating four valid variants,
    was a possibility. But I decided to do something simpler to construct
    (perhaps someone else can take up this challenge?).
    </p>
    <p>
    I decided to use roman numerals in those squares, to indicate clue numbers
    for words that needed to be swapped. The only candidates had to be the
    single-lettered numbers, “i”, “v”, and “x”. Using “i” would have been
    ambiguous, as the grid at that point had both a 1-across and a 1-down. But
    adjusting the grid to ensure that there was only an across clue at both 5
    and 10, and the two had the same length, was not too hard.
    </p>
    <p>
    So, at this point, I had a grid, and I just had the letter constraints that
    there had to be a V or an X in two specific locations. The rest was just a
    regular grid-fill. I did want to add a nina word, and the theme of swapping
    coupled with an unfortunately depraved free-associative imagination (my
    favourite clue in the grid is THORNY) made me fill SPOUSES as the nina.
    That then suggested that the two words to be swapped could be HEATED
    and VERBAL, as a “heated verbal exchange” between spouses is a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
    The title of the grid, “Cursory Appearances,” is a play on the fact that
    cursory appearances may not reveal the full story, as well as that the two
    ends of the double-sided arrow “appear” to resemble “cursors.”
